<h3> 2/20/25</h3>
    <p>
    A second consecutive skiing post, with this one being a little more successful than the last! This past weekend I was up in Skeikampen, a ski resort a little <br>outside the town of Lillehammer, a two and a half hour drive north of Oslo. Lillehammer is best known for being the site of the 1994 Winter Olympics, which <br>actually are the most watched Olympic games of all time (one of my favorite fun facts, it’s because of the drama between Nancy Kerrigan, Tonya Harding, and <br>the hitman hired by Tonya Harding’s husband - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_of_Nancy_Kerrigan">wikipedia link here</a> for those unaware of the story). Future aspiring curling career aside, I wasn’t up there <br>for any Olympic related reasons, but actually because the weekend was a ski retreat for the Fulbright program, meaning it was a chance to finally catch up <br>with the other Americans in Norway for the year, many of whom I hadn’t seen since our orientation in August. This time around, I opted for the familiar <br>terrain of downhill skiing and having two feet fully strapped into the skis beneath me. The mountain was on the smaller side, but the skiing was still <br>pretty nice and the runs were not too busy. Several of the other Fulbrighters skied as well, so it was also a lot of fun to join them on the slopes. While <br>I’m not sure about other Norwegian ski resorts, this one particularly had an affinity for T-bar style lifts where you have to sit and hold onto a pole as <br>it drags you up the mountain. I was not particularly a fan of the T-bars, but if nothing else they did provide more of a reprieve from the wind, which in <br>addition to the single digit (Fahrenheit) temperatures in the morning created a pretty chilly mountain. I was without any sort of face covering, and while <br>I was fine to tough it out for the two days I did get the (now familiar) sensation of my mustache freezing to my face as a parting gift.

    Beyond the skiing, it was also nice to hear more about the other Fulbrighters’ years. The experience of moving to a new country is often so unique and filled <br>with so many challenges to overcome that it’s easy to feel like you’re somehow doing it “wrong”, and particularly with the abridged timeline of only being <br>here a year, feel like you’re not getting as much out of the experience as you can. However, getting to hear from others’ times in Norway, it was a nice <br>reminder that a lot of the challenges are shared. I had a weird experience on the subway several weeks ago where I had a security guard ask to see my <br>student ID to validate my student ticket, and when I showed my ID told me that it wasn’t a valid ID (?) and that I couldn’t be a student here because I <br>didn’t speak Norwegian (??) before eventually letting me go after an uncomfortable 5-10 minutes. I later found out that most schools have an app they do <br>their student IDs through, which I do not have going to a much smaller school and also having a kind of in-between status as a Fulbright grantee. It was <br>frustrating at the time, but this past weekend I heard others share their experiences with militant transit authorities which made my own run-in feel a <br>little less personal. On more fun notes, it was also really interesting to hear the hobbies people had picked up in their time here, the Norwegian phrases <br>some had learned, and also to hear how city cultures varied across different regions of the country. I’m hoping to stay in touch with everyone and <br>hopefully will get the chance to visit a few people while traveling around Norway in the next several months!
    <br><br>
    For a relatively small country, the differences between areas of Norway are surprisingly distinct, and are something that people are very proud of. Some of it <br>might be due to Norway’s history of having a fairly decentralized population (which is understandable given the number of mountains and fjords separating <br>different regions) as well as political history such as the level of interaction with Danish rule hundreds of years ago. In the modern day though, it means <br>that most other places are not massive fans of Oslo (which once received the derogatory nickname the “tiger city” to reference what the higher levels of <br>crime, which might be true compared to other parts of Norway, but is still far less than really almost any other part of the world), and that Norwegians in <br>different parts of the country have dialects that make their speech sound like entirely different languages. These dialect differences are hardly limited <br>to just slang too. The Norwegian word for “I”, spelt jeg in Bokmål, the standard Norwegian you learn in a textbook (pronounced y-eye in English), is <br>instead spelt eg if you’re from Bergen, and pronounced like “egg” in English. While Bokmål is still what’s taught in school, people text and speak in <br>dialect outside of formal contexts, and especially for younger people, keeping your home dialect when you move to new places if often a point of pride.
    <br><br>
    Even within regions, there remain more differences in how people spell and pronounce words. Norwegian nouns are either masculine, feminine, or neutral, which <br>means in the definitive form (which in English means having “the” in front like “the dog”) the words end in -en, -a, and -et respectively. So a masculine <br>noun like katt (cat) would be katten (the cat), a feminine noun like bok (book) would be boka, and a neutral noun like hus (house) would be huset (the <br>house). However! In Norwegian, all feminine nouns can also be masculine nouns. So, for the above example, if you spelt “the book” as “boken”, that would be <br>equally correct. The use of feminine nouns is completely optional, and use varies even within regions, with some exceptions like Bergen which almost never <br>uses them. One of my roommates, from Ålesund on the west coast of Norway since location definitely matters, suggested that feminine nouns are more working <br>class, since the Danish language does not have feminine nouns and the elite of Norway were historically those tied to the Danish ruling class. However, in <br>the modern day, it seems mostly arbitrary, but is another interesting wrinkle in a language where truly no two people speak the same, something that can be <br>said about most languages but with Norwegian seems to be more of a fact of everyday life.

    In one last anecdote though, these barriers to communication are hardly limited to just Norwegian. My roommate Sebastian is an avid reader, particularly of <br>classic novels, which means that his English vocabulary includes an array of English that peaked in use roughly 200 years ago. So, not only has been <br>telling me what words mean in Norwegian, he’s also taught me the words “comported” and “exigency” in the last week. While I haven’t fully been able to <br>repay the favor, I did teach him the word “charcuterie” a couple days ago which has to count for something.

    The intense local pride in Norway also extends to musicians from specific cities, which has inspired me to look more into more artists from Phoenix! I made <br><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6jNZ14qzLs79GzzPe8uBt5?si=7bd41aecb32649ef">this playlist</a> with some of the more notable artists from my research + a few of my other favorites, otherwise the EUSEXUA album by FKA twigs and Homecoming <br>by The Teenagers

    <h3> 2/3/25</h3>
    <p>
    Jeg gikk på ski! This past week, I completed one of the last major pre-requisites to full Norwegian personhood when I went cross country skiing for the first <br>time. Before I got to Norway, I knew that the sport was one of the country’s favorite pastimes, but in retrospect, I think I somehow still vastly <br>underestimated its cultural impact. Since I have been here, the news, celebrities, and even the work day revolve around skiing and access to skiing.

    Many major ski events are must see TV events. A couple weeks ago, my roommates and I gathered around to watch a biathlon race (the combination of cross county <br>skiing and rifle shooting, obviously, or as said in Norwegian, “skiskyting”) which Norway would lose in dramatic fashion to the Swedish team. On the home <br>stretch the Swedish skier tripped the Norwegian “accidentally” with one of their poles, generating a fair amount of controversy here, especially with the <br>loss coming to Sweden (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uauYrfXMlXc">The video is here</a> - you be the judge). In other areas of Norwegian culture, Norwegian skiers and ski events make up common answers <br>for a lot of Norway’s huge trivia culture, a humbling fact for myself when I try to hang in there with my now useless encyclopedic American sports <br>knowledge - nobody here is interested in past Cy Young winners. The name recognition with skiers even goes to the point that when Rachel visited in <br>December and sat next to a 2017 world championship bronze medalist in the 15km race on the plane (with that race being their only ever individual medal I <br>might add), I mentioned the name to a few of my roommates and people at work and unanimously people knew who the person was. For workdays, I’ve learned <br>that working from home in the winter is shorthand for going skiing all morning, and the gym in my office has a machine that simulates using your poles <br>while skiing. Skiing is also a popular sport at all times a day - with most runs being lit up by streetlights it’s pretty typical to see a run busy most of <br>the night. Even in my incredibly niche world of electronic monitoring, probation officers I’ve talked to have mentioned that public acceptance around EM <br>grew after a major Norwegian skiing star received a criminal charge and was sentenced via EM, allowing them to continue to complete with their ankle <br>bracelet on. It truly bears no understatement. This is a country that loves to ski.
    <br><br>
    However, without skis and with a warmer winter than usual in Oslo so far, I hadn’t gotten the chance to try it out for myself yet. That was before Berit, my <br>research advisor at KRUS, invited me to try skiing with her one evening after work this past week. Fortunately, one of her kids has the same shoe size as <br>me, so I borrowed their equipment for the day and we went up to Linderudkollen, a forest area north of Oslo with cross country skiing runs. Going into the <br>day, I was cautiously optimistic about my own cross country skiing ability. Downhill skiing, as most Norwegians would refer to how most Americans typically <br>ski going down a mountain, came relatively easy to me from my background ice skating when I first learned it. I figured since I was pretty familiar both <br>with the concept of skiing and just the concept of balancing on two narrow things on your feet more generally, I would at least be able to be passable <br>without too much of a problem.

    This was not the case! The differences in the two sports became all too apparent to me once I went tumbling down into the snow two times in my first five <br>minutes on the run. The biggest immediate issue for me was that with cross country skis, your feet are only strapped in to the front of the skis, meaning <br>that you need to lean fairly far forward while moving. However, when I’ve gone skiing downhill, I would often lean back to regain my balance since your <br>feet are strapped in on both your sides to your skis. Doing this, I found out over and over as I tried to fight my skiing instincts, is the fastest way to <br>wipeout while skiing cross country. I did get slightly better as the night went along, improving at falling forward as Berit taught me to move, but the <br>final fall count was at 6 through an hour and a half, and while going down hills I was reduced to skiing full pizza style like I was back in ski school on <br>the bunny slopes.
    <br><br>
    For all my struggles though, between cross country skiing and learning the Norwegian language more generally, I am grateful for my time in Norway as a chance <br>to be really, really, bad at things. It’s not often outside of this experience that I’ve recently gotten to be a complete beginner at something , and it <br>does challenge me to keep going when I’m not immediately good and enjoy the small victories that come with slowly getting better. It was definitely <br>humbling to be the worst skier on the slopes, especially in front of someone who I had told I had experience downhill skiing to (and who was probably <br>wondering if I had been lying this whole time about there being snow in Arizona after seeing me fall once again). It’s also humbling to feel like I’m <br>understanding more and more Norwegian and then stumble when someone asks me “hvordan går det” (how are you) in the office. To make my own Yogism, with <br>Norwegian I’m more often remembering all the things I forgot. But, at the same time, it’s gratifying when my roommates show me some video in Norwegian and <br>I understand what they’re talking about, and even in skiing, there were still small victories like when I made it down a hill for the first time without <br>falling.
    <br><br>
    In terms of my skiing redemption, fortunately the Fulbright program has a ski weekend in a couple weeks where I can embarrass myself in front of people I at <br>least don’t see every day at work, so I’m looking forward to getting skis on once again soon! My roommate Peik also wants to teach me the “skating” <br>technique for skiing, different the more traditional “walking” technique that Berit taught me (Side note, but this technique is baked into how Norwegians <br>say they’re going skiing! Saying you’re going skiing, or “Jeg går på ski”, literally translates to “I’m walking on skis”). Even when it’s with fun <br>activities like skiing, feeling out of your element is definitely part of the challenge of moving to a new country sometimes, but it’s still a feeling I’m <br>very happy to get to experience :)
