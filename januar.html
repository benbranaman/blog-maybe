   <h3> 1/21/25</h3>
    <p>
    Nytt år samme meg kanskje. I’ve spent two weeks back in Oslo since my brief return to the states over the holidays, and in some ways, the vestiges of a winter <br>past are starting to rear their head. The festive lights that had dotted the city since early November have been put away for the time being, and the <br>darkness, though still omnipresent, is receding. On my morning train rides to work, I’m even now getting glimpses of the sunrise before 9am. 
    <br><br>
    Of course, while in some ways winter is flying by, at other times I’m very aware of what exactly living at the 60th parallel entails. A common refrain I had <br>while back in Phoenix was that through my first few months in Norway, I realized that I actually liked cold weather. Before I moved, I always thought I <br>did, and felt that especially growing up around an ice rink I had a greater tolerance to the cold, only rivaled maybe by a 12-year-old unwilling admit <br>they might need a sweatshirt in the morning. And while I had never experienced weather like what’s common in Norway, my experiences in Oslo through <br>November and December in and around 20 degrees Fahrenheit confirmed to me I liked bundling up and embracing the cold. I even got in a few runs in around <br>the 20 degree mark and came out mostly unscathed, and to this day (majorly knocking on wood here) I have not slipped and fell on any of the ice around the <br>city. But, to put it delicately, my first week back made me eat my words.
    <br><br>
    I was welcomed back into the fray at a cool clip of 7 degrees, and within my first 24 hours the temperature had bottomed out around 4. When the winter was <br>first approaching, I had internally prepared by trying to log how many layers of clothing I needed at each successive level of cold. 35 degrees warrants a <br>puffer jacket, 30 degrees gloves, the high 20s long underwear, and the mid to low 20s additionally a scarf. In times of desperation and the few days in <br>which the weather dipped into the teens in December, I also had beanies and thicker gloves to lean on. What I’ve found out about single digits is that, <br>much like the 110s in Phoenix, at some point there’s really a limit to what else you can do besides staying inside. I attempted a run when things were at <br>the 7 or 8 degree mark and found out there is a level of cold in which your lungs do just start to hurt. The more you know! Unfortunately too, I have been <br>informed there isn’t any prophet-like figure like Punxsutawney Phil to give me the heads up on end of the season, so for the time being I’m assuming this <br>will be lasting all the way through most of March. 
    <br><br>
    Adding to that weather shock is the fact that between Monday and Tuesday last week, Oslo got over a foot of snow, and in some areas a outside of the city like <br>Lillestrøm, where my office is, the amount was closer to two feet. Particularly on Tuesday, the snowflakes were larger than anything I’d seen before, and <br>the combination of the cold and snow resulted in a series of events that I easily could have foreseen, but stumbled into nonetheless. Monday night, as the <br>snow was first picking up, I needed a quick run to the grocery store having finally overcome my jet lag from the trip a few days prior. But, since I also <br>wanted to grab a quick dinner for the next day because my weekly Norwegian class was scheduled to be virtual and I was planning on logging in from my <br>office, I decided to take the longer walk, a little under 15 minutes, to the larger grocery store further north of my apartment. Upon taking my first step <br>out the door, several things all started to simultaneously occur.
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">

        <td><img src="images/IMG_6905.jpg" alt="work view"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>The snow has also meant a nicer view from my office!</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    Immediately, I began to pay my penance for my lack of hood, or any type of face covering at all, save a scarf that I did eventually figure out how to wear <br>after making my way through a WikiHow article (actually very helpful). First, my forehead started to go numb, a feeling that I was not aware existed until <br>it began. The wind at this time was also beginning to pick up, giving me the great privilege of walking directly into the onslaught of snow pouring down. <br>Pretty quickly, the snowflakes that had lodged themselves into my mustache began to freeze and fuse together, which give a small of dose of foreshadowing <br>for what was to occur to the rest of my hair minutes later. I’m sure if someone was to pass me on the street at this point they might have offered some <br>remark or possibly advice to get in the market for some better winter gear. The unfortunate part then would be that I wouldn’t have been able to answer, <br>since the next thing to go was a growing numbness in my lips. All this is to stay as I trudged up the few steps up and into the foyer of the grocery <br>store, I became plainly aware of all the other patrons who did not have their hair fused together in one icy block. Through some degree of typical <br>Norwegian non-confrontation, my state of affairs was not a topic of conversation as I reached the checkout counter, but the extra glances I received were <br>loud enough. Fortunately, the return journey was with the wind and snow at my back, though my hair still largely met the same fate before I mercifully <br>scrambled back up the stairs to my apartment. To add insult to injury, my virtual class the next evening was canceled since the snow had trapped my <br>professor in their cabin up north without their teaching materials, rendering my journey mostly as just as some sort of hard-love character building <br>exercise.

    Though my first introduction to snow here started on a somewhat rough note, I got some redemption the following weekend when I started my Norwegian winter <br>sports career. Saturday was a perfect winter’s day, sunny and in the mid 20s, and with December being a little warmer than usual, it was obvious all the <br>locals were itching to hit the slopes. Owing to Oslo’s fantastic public transit system, the subway has stops all the way up to (cross country) skiing <br>trails a little outside the city, and as a result, when I first stepped into the subway car from the middle of the city that morning, it was already <br>filled with people of all ages almost exclusively carrying skis. As an aside, one of my coworkers recently mentioned to me he had gone out skiing with his <br>three-year-old, and this is not an uncommon occurrence. The adage goes that Norwegians are born on skis, and though the country’s low c-section rate <br>doesn’t seem to support this theory, I’m inclined to agree.
    <br><br>
    That afternoon though, it was sledding that one of my fellow Fulbrighters and I were after, and we took the t-bane up to Korketrekkeren, a 2 kilometer-long <br>sledding trail that actually begins and ends at different subway stops along a mountain, so you can take public transit right back to the top of the hill. <br>This trail though was a little more extreme than any sort of plastic disc-type sledding I’d done before in Flagstaff or the like. Instead, the sled was <br>wooden and had more of a toboggan-type of design, with a rope you held that you could pull to increase your speed while digging your heels into the snow <br>to steer. With a steeper incline, it was pretty easy to build up speed, and along the trail, the sledding tracks of others before created makeshift ramps <br>to navigate up and around on the journey. There also were several sharp corners, leading to some ugly wipeouts ahead of me and subsequent cries of <br>“forsiktig” (for-sheik-tea, careful in Norwegian) from those already sprawled across the snow. The entire thing was a blast, and I’m looking forward to <br>the next snow storm so I can go back.

    This was a little bit of a longer update since it took me awhile to get this all up and going again, but already there’s a lot more to share now that I’ve <br>officially crossed the halfway point (!!!) of my time here. Ha det for nå!
