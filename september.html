<h3>9/5/24</h3>
    <p>
    My work within the Norwegian Correctional Service (NCS) took a big step forward last week, when I joined the correctional officer students at <br>KRUS to visit a Norwegian prison for the first time. Romerike Fengsel, (fengsel “fang-sill” is prison in Norwegian) is the largest prison <br>in Norway with a capacity of 286 people, and is a high-security facility for serious offenders. For reference, the Perryville prison in <br>Goodyear that I typically worked in at ASU has a capacity of 2300 people, which would make it just the 6th largest facility in Arizona. <br>Things are a lot different here.
    <br><br>
    That much was obvious even before walking through the front gate. For one, there was no dress code to be made aware of before the visit. No <br>bans on blue or red to avoid gang affiliation, no disallowing orange because it’s too close to the color of the prison jumpsuits, and no <br>preventing brown since it’s the color of the officer’s uniforms. Just plain clothes were all that were required to walk through the door - <br>the same the inmates themselves were wearing: their own clothes. The officers taking us around even let some of the students bring their <br>snus in along with them. A side note but snus, the European version of zyns, are way more popular than any sort of nicotine product I’ve <br>ever seen back in the US, and are shockingly common really anywhere you are in public. One of the other American Fulbrighters in Oslo even <br>mentioned one of their professors putting in a snu in while giving a lecture.
    <br><br>
    Within the prison, these differences persisted. The cells were much larger than their American counterparts, about the size of a dorm room, <br>with no cellmates and a TV at the end of each bed. Each cell also included its own toilet and shower, something I haven’t seen in any <br>prison I’ve been to. As mentioned before, each prison unit also comes with a communal kitchen, and also a shared living space with board <br>games and an xbox. Other features, like an inmate gym (much nicer than the one I’ve been using at KRUS) and soccer field are similarly <br>unheard of in the states. To finish off the tour, we were also shown the prison’s visitation rooms (including hotel ish rooms for <br>overnight visits that are allowed with partners) and also the officer’s training area - which doubles as a basketball court for the rest <br>of the prison when it isn’t being used.

    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    Even interactions between officers and inmates are far different than what I’m used to. Upon entering one unit, one of the students on the <br>tour - who was translating things to English for me since he had previously worked at that prison a few years prior - saw one of the <br>inmates he had worked with during his time at Romerike. Upon seeing each other, the two ran up and gave each other a big hug, before <br>joking and catching up for a minute. The officer guiding us joined in talking with the two, before allowing the inmate to take over the <br>tour for a minute to show us his area. Coming from a system where many older officers refuse to even shake the hand of any incarcerated <br>person, to call this a culture shock would be a massive understatement.
    <br><br>
    Despite the contrast, there still are a lot of asterisks that come with any prison, and especially the experience of touring one. Norway and <br>the NCS are incredibly impressive in their dedication to rehabilitation, but no amount of TVs and xboxes really distract from the fact <br>that you are in a prison. The experience of being separated from families, homes, and jobs is still omnipresent regardless of the country. <br>Tours themselves only show the aspects of a prison that officers would like to show - and although the officers of our tour were fairly <br>transparent about the use of more restrictive measures, particularly solitary confinement (something the NCS has been internationally <br>criticized of for their frequent use), there still always is another side. Prison tours themselves happen without the consent of any <br>person incarcerated, and while valuable in my experience to give context to what I read and hear about from inmates, there is not much of <br>a choice involved on their part with my being there.
    <br><br>
    All of this is to say there’s a lot to think about. My project focuses instead on people sentenced through at-home electronic monitoring, <br>rather than in a prison, but understanding the experiences of both are necessary to contextualize how to minimize the structural <br>difficulties people face at the end of their sentence. A lighter post about Scandinavian summer is coming soon, but thought a quick look <br>into what I’m working on was needed :)
