 <h3> 12/14/24</h3>
    <p>
    I’m just five days out from ending my first semester (if you can call it that - my brain is still wired on the school calendar) in Norway. I’m excited to be <br>home and see everyone I’ve missed and have things be familiar for a bit, but I’m also excited to continue my time here in the new year and learn more <br>about life in this country. There continue to be new wrinkles and traditions I learn about each week. Yesterday was Saint Lucy’s Day, a holiday I did not <br>know existed until it was almost over. It celebrates Saint Lucy, or Lucia, who was given sainthood for her efforts in the fourth century to bring food <br>and other supplies to Christians hiding from religious persecution from Romans before she was eventually captured and killed herself. According to legend <br>she traveled through the night with a candle on her head so she could carry more food in her hands, and with the day also falling close to the winter <br>equinox the day is celebrated as a festival of light. Strangely, Scandinavia is the only region in the world that celebrates this holiday (with the major <br>exception of the island nation of Saint Lucia, for obvious reasons) and despite its religious nature, these celebrations also take place in schools and <br>in the workplace. I was working from home yesterday, not knowing what I was missing out on, but my office had a candle lighting ceremony and people baked <br>saffron buns, the traditional food of Saint Lucy’s Day. I didn’t totally miss out on the celebration though, as after my hockey practices in the evening <br>one parent came in with their own homemade saffron buns for the team.

    This close tie of religion to everyday traditions is something that is fairly common in Norway, which is particularly interesting given Norway’s relatively <br>liberal values and the fact that, by and large, Norway isn’t really a church-going country. Only about 5% of Norwegians attend a religious ceremony each <br>week, compared to one poll that puts the US at around 42%. Despite this, Norway has an official state religion (Lutheran Protestantism), and an official <br>Church of Norway that the King of Norway presided over until 2012, and the Church remained under the jurisdiction of the government until 2017 when it <br>became a separate organization. So, despite the current disinterest in church-going, holiday traditions commonly take a religious form, such as in <br>schools where one of my roommates shared with me it’s common to attend a church service together with your class before leaving for winter break. The <br>country’s ties to religion is another element that reflects the fact that for a long time, Norway has been a pretty homogenous society, and until very <br>recently, there haven’t been too many large religious minorities. In many ways, the acceptance of a new, more diverse, Norway defines many of the <br>challenges the country faces going forward.
    <br><br>
    In non-Norwegian news, last week I attended the Confederation of European Probation’s Electronic Monitoring conference, which is to say I really roughed it <br>up on a beach in Portugal for a few days while basking in the 70 degrees and sunny weather, a full 40 degrees warmer than what I was missing back in <br>Oslo. The experience was an interesting one, in the sense both that I got a better understanding of the criminal justice landscape in Europe, and also <br>that I was acting both as a representative of the US and as a representative of Norway. The contradiction of being an American in a Norway name tag for <br>one caused a lot of language confusion - I was immensely disappointing to Swedes who came up to me speaking Swedish only to realize I didn’t understand a <br>word they were saying, and also pleasantly surprising to Brits who complimented me on how good my English was (thanks, I’d hope so). 
    <br><br>
    Attendees were from all corners of the justice system - some people were researchers like me, and others were politicians, judges, correctional officers, <br>probation workers, attorneys, and about everything in between. Though I was a little nervous about attending without really knowing anyone there, I found <br>these shared experiences made chatting with strangers a lot easier, and networking came a lot more naturally to me when I was talking about something I <br>actually cared about than other career events I had ever attended. Comparing the approaches to justice between countries was the main area of interest <br>for the week though, especially with Norway considered such an international leader in the area. In some ways, I did feel that Norway had an approach I <br>preferred to other countries. For one, while part of the conference discussed advanced technology to use to track people incarcerated through EM or other <br>people of interest, it was primarily the Scandinavian delegation that voiced concerns about not using more invasive technology than was necessary for <br>public safety, and reducing stigma when possible. There were even some talks from the Norwegian constituents to have ankle bracelets used for Electronic <br>Monitoring go on the wrist and have the appearance of a watch, to hopefully reduce the stigma people feel going into public wearing an ankle bracelet.

    However, there were other topics in the conference that illustrated areas in which the Scandinavian countries are less humane than other European systems. <br>Unlike the US, jails or temporary holding centers aren’t really a thing for people who have been charged with a crime but are still awaiting their trial. <br>Typically people are either let go until their trial in low-risk situations, or are put into the same prison they would be in if they were convicted <br>temporarily, typically in a separate pre-trial detention wing. In Scandinavia, where fears that a person may tamper with evidence pre-trial are much <br>greater than other countries, this will even mean keeping people in solitary confinement for long periods of time before their trial. In cases like <br>these, or when the conditions of pre-trial prison wings aren’t any different to other areas of the prison, this system doesn’t particularly respect the <br>presumption of innocent until proven guilty that is supposed to be the basis for justice systems. The conference discussed EM as a possible alternative <br>to these high rates of pre-trial detention, and I think if implemented correctly could be a positive development for Norway to take away.

    This might be my last Norway update until after the holidays, so for the time being God Jul and Godt Nytt År! Excited to see what Norway brings me in 2025 :)
