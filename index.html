    <h1>Ben lives in Norway and blogs sometimes</h1>
    <h5> Hei og velkommen! I've always wanted a terrible html website (à la Space Jam and the Heaven's Gate cult - two things commonly referred to in the same sentence) and so this is my attempt to document my year abroad in Norway. Enjoy :D </h5>
    <h3> 8/21/24 </h3>
    <p>
    It’s a little past noon, and I’m sitting on the second floor of the Oslo public library. The crowd is mixed - students like myself <br>clustered around desks and outlets, kids from school groups in yellow crossing guard vests running outside of the watch of their teachers, <br>and tourists wandering in from the nearby museums to snap a couple pictures before braving the rain once again. It’s an impressive <br>building, even in a city that noticeably dedicates itself to public spaces. Sitting on the harbor, it’s an Oslo landmark along with <br>the nearby opera house (operahuset). But regardless of the place, it’s here that I've come to say I'm nearly a week into my stay in <br>Norway.
    <br><br>
    The first few days have been a blur, a mix of ikea stops, tourist sights, and return trips to ikea after realizing that I still don’t actually <br>have bedsheets. This too has been while not knowing much of the language at all - something that's made little things like getting <br>groceries more difficult so far. The time I've spent looking blankly at different brands of greek yogurt is absurd. Fortunately, most <br>people speak good English - particularly close to the city center, which has made asking for help relatively easy. Even still, I'm trying <br>to pick up as much Norwegian as I can, though right now that's mostly limited to hei's (means hi, pronounced the same way) and unnskyld <br>med's (means excuse me, pronounced oon-shill may). It's a work in progress - though I've been assured that Norwegians sometimes can't even <br>understand other Norwegians because some regional dialects are so strong.
    <br><br>
    Yesterday was my first day at KRUS, the University College of the Norwegian Correctional Service, where I’ll be spending my year <br>researching Electronic Monitoring - essentially house arrest - in Norway. Already, the Norwegian approach to corrections is much different <br>than anything I’ve worked with before. Here, the training to become a correctional officer is a two-year program (and may become a three-<br>year bachelor's degree soon), where in addition to practical training students get classes in social work, sociology, philosophy, and <br>criminology. While security is still a primary focus in prison, there's also a much greater emphasis on job training, education, and <br>living in a way that prepares people for life after their release. For one, Norwegian prisoners have a shared kitchen and make their own food, with <br>access to kitchen tools up to and including knives.
    <br><br>
    On one last note, my room is finally starting to look like a place where someone lives! Last night I set up my cork board, something for me <br>that always makes a place a home. It was the first thing I set up in my Barrett dorm, and the last thing I took down moving out from my <br>apartment a couple weeks ago. I’m hoping to add a couple more stickers and postcards as I travel around here, but for now it’s nice to <br>have some reminders of home :)
