    Norwegian is a strange language. It’s at once relatively easy to read, since the grammar is pretty similar to English, but also very difficult <br>to pronounce and understand. It’s also a difficult language to learn at times, not because of the language itself, but because of many <br>Norwegian’s competency in English. I’m now two weeks into my weekly Norwegian class (norskkurs if you will), held at the University of Oslo <br>for international researchers, and am finding that others are facing the same dilemma. The class is an eclectic bunch, a group of 20 or so <br>that spans about 15 different countries of origin - and 6 different continents of origin at that. I’m the lone American representative. <br>While some of our makeshift UN is like me, having just arrived in the country (one month ago today to be exact!), others have been here <br>much longer, up to 10 years in some cases. Since many Norwegians are willing to switch to English while speaking so quick, you really can <br>get by that long if you want to. This fact was also echoed by some at the Fulbright office - if you want to learn, you have to make a <br>specific effort to speak and struggle through the language.
    <br><br>
    It’s with this in mind that I’ve been using my newly acquired library card so peruse the picture book section of the Oslo library to checkout <br>books like the riveting “Lars er Stor” (meaning “Lars is big”) - horrifying illustrations and all. No spoilers to those at home, but Lars <br>IS bigger than the baby but is NOT bigger than the mountain or the tree. I’m on the edge of my seat with every page.

    In a little bit of a history lesson, Norwegian also bizarrely has two different written forms: bokmål and nynorsk. Until 1814, Norway was under <br>Danish rule, and during that time spoke mostly Danish with a little bit of Viking-era Norwegian mixed in. However, after a bizarre treaty <br>in which Denmark essentially said “our bad” for being allied with France after Napoleon tried to invade most of Europe, they agreed to <br>leave Norway under Swedish control. With Danish rule over, many Norwegians saw the opportunity to establish a new, truly Norwegian, <br>official language. Most agreed that codifying how most people spoke (particularly in cities) - the Danish/old Norwegian blend - made the <br>most sense, and this would become bokmål. Today, this is the kind of Norwegian 90% of the population speaks, and is what I learn in my <br>class. However, one Norwegian named Ivan Aasen felt that cities were already too “corrupted by the Danish”. He undertook a genuinely insane <br>decade-plus long journey where he traveled from small village to small village in Norway, where he compiled all the local dialects he <br>encountered into a different version called nynorsk (ny, pronounced “knee”, means new so “New Norwegian”). This similar-ish language is <br>what 10% of people still speak today, most of those people being on the west coast where Aasen was from, and nynorsk is still a mandatory <br>subject in all Norwegian schools. However, in recent years, mass media has eroded the use of nynorsk, making its legacy an active area of <br>public debate.
    <br><br>
    All of this is to say that even if I somehow become coherent in bokmål someday, I have a whole entire other language still to learn.

    Even when I know the right word to use, other cultural differences have still at times lead me astray. I mentioned in my first post I was <br>getting by with lots of “unnskyld”s, the Norwegian word for “excuse me” - at least, per Duolingo. However, I also learned that at times the <br>word means closer to the word sorry, but so does another word, “beklager”. I was asking my roommate about when to use which word when he <br>got confused about what I was asking… because Norwegians really just don’t say excuse me. They do, occasionally, but in a country that by <br>and large is extremely reluctant to talk to strangers, the inconvenience of having someone talk to you is considered way more rude than <br>anything you might have done to get in their way in the first place. So, by trying to use the language and keep out of people’s way, I <br>might have been outing myself as an overeager American this entire time.

    In Norway, the working world comes to a shrieking halt on Sundays. Everything - grocery stores, your neighborhood Ikea, and the like, is <br>closed. Save for the library and a couple convenience stores here and there (with higher prices because workers must be paid overtime on <br>Sundays) - you’re left to your own devices for the day. Sometimes, this is inconvenient. My first full day in Norway was a Sunday, and <br>after having slept 15 hours the night before recovering from jet lag, I was ready to hit the ground running. No dice. If you didn’t get <br>groceries the night before, Sunday is a long day.
    <br><br>
    Otherwise though, Sundays are when the city comes alive. The first of my last couple of Sundays marked the beginning of one last heatwave <br>(peaking at 81 degrees - so a Phoenix Thanksgiving) to cap Oslo’s summer. And people were dead set on not missing their last few days of <br>warmth.  My day started in Grünerløkka (grew-nehr-luck-uh), one of the trendier neighborhoods in the city, where on my way to meet a <br>fellow American Fulbrighter for coffee I was met with food stands, flea markets, and vintage clothing racks dotting the street. Literal <br>hundreds of people filled the sidewalks, in a way that felt befitting of some sort of oncoming parade, but it was just Sunday. Youth <br>sports teams sold home-baked cookies and pastries to fund their upcoming seasons, and school band and orchestra groups shuffled around <br>tables selling used winter and ski gear. Interestingly, across all stands, sales were conducted almost exclusively with Vipps, Norway’s <br>version of Venmo. Norway is an impressively cashless country, to the extent that a few years ago a bill was nearly passed to outlaw cash <br>altogether. Outside of the tip jar at said coffee place, I still have not seen a single Norwegian bill in my 3+ weeks here.
    <br><br>
    Coffee in hand, my day moved on to Hovedøya, the largest island in the fjord - the literal translation is hoved (main) øya (island), very <br>creative <3 - that lines the southern edge of Oslo. The island was a 10 minute ferry ride from the harbor, a journey that is part of the <br>city’s public transit system since some people commute to work by boat, something that feels very far from the many hours I’ve spent <br>agonizing around the I-10 I-17 interchange. On the short ride over, it was evident the crowds weren’t much different from what I saw in <br>the morning. Across the half dozen or so islands close to shore, dozens of families filled the landscape cruising on boats, swimming in <br>the water, lounging on beaches, or jumping from the rocks hanging over the bay. Hovedøya itself was packed with groups taking advantage of <br>its many walking trails (though after half a mile or so myself I lost most of the crowd) and grilling along its shorelines. It’s not just <br>in practice too that Norwegians take advantage of their natural surroundings. Allemannsretten, also known as the right to roam, legally <br>protects outdoor recreation on uncultivated land, even when that land is private property. These Sunday traditions are woven into the <br>fabric of Norwegian law.

    My day bookended with a morning run along Akerselva, the river that winds itself through the heart of Oslo, and a movie (Black Swan, which I <br>chose entirely because of the Childish Gambino lyric in Freaks & Geeks and had no idea what I was getting myself into), my full weekend <br>was complete. This emphasis on making the most of your weekends has been a special part of my time in Norway so far. It is never expected <br>to do work beyond or outside of work hours (some of this too is adjusting to working and not having homework), and Norwegians in general <br>are very protective of their work-life balance. This identity even takes shape in basic questions: while Americans might respond to “What <br>do you do?” with their job, Norwegians might be more likely to respond to the question with some of their hobbies. In short, it makes for <br>a very pleasant recharge before the work week starts up. I love my Scandinavian Sundays.

    My work within the Norwegian Correctional Service (NCS) took a big step forward last week, when I joined the correctional officer students at <br>KRUS to visit a Norwegian prison for the first time. Romerike Fengsel, (fengsel “fang-sill” is prison in Norwegian) is the largest prison <br>in Norway with a capacity of 286 people, and is a high-security facility for serious offenders. For reference, the Perryville prison in <br>Goodyear that I typically worked in at ASU has a capacity of 2300 people, which would make it just the 6th largest facility in Arizona. <br>Things are a lot different here.
    <br><br>
    That much was obvious even before walking through the front gate. For one, there was no dress code to be made aware of before the visit. No <br>bans on blue or red to avoid gang affiliation, no disallowing orange because it’s too close to the color of the prison jumpsuits, and no <br>preventing brown since it’s the color of the officer’s uniforms. Just plain clothes were all that were required to walk through the door - <br>the same the inmates themselves were wearing: their own clothes. The officers taking us around even let some of the students bring their <br>snus in along with them. A side note but snus, the European version of zyns, are way more popular than any sort of nicotine product I’ve <br>ever seen back in the US, and are shockingly common really anywhere you are in public. One of the other American Fulbrighters in Oslo even <br>mentioned one of their professors putting in a snu in while giving a lecture.
    <br><br>
    Within the prison, these differences persisted. The cells were much larger than their American counterparts, about the size of a dorm room, <br>with no cellmates and a TV at the end of each bed. Each cell also included its own toilet and shower, something I haven’t seen in any <br>prison I’ve been to. As mentioned before, each prison unit also comes with a communal kitchen, and also a shared living space with board <br>games and an xbox. Other features, like an inmate gym (much nicer than the one I’ve been using at KRUS) and soccer field are similarly <br>unheard of in the states. To finish off the tour, we were also shown the prison’s visitation rooms (including hotel ish rooms for <br>overnight visits that are allowed with partners) and also the officer’s training area - which doubles as a basketball court for the rest <br>of the prison when it isn’t being used.
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">

        <td><b>Other online picture of a unit common area. Officer station can <br>be seen through the glass in the back</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    Even interactions between officers and inmates are far different than what I’m used to. Upon entering one unit, one of the students on the <br>tour - who was translating things to English for me since he had previously worked at that prison a few years prior - saw one of the <br>inmates he had worked with during his time at Romerike. Upon seeing each other, the two ran up and gave each other a big hug, before <br>joking and catching up for a minute. The officer guiding us joined in talking with the two, before allowing the inmate to take over the <br>tour for a minute to show us his area. Coming from a system where many older officers refuse to even shake the hand of any incarcerated <br>person, to call this a culture shock would be a massive understatement.
    <br><br>
    Despite the contrast, there still are a lot of asterisks that come with any prison, and especially the experience of touring one. Norway and <br>the NCS are incredibly impressive in their dedication to rehabilitation, but no amount of TVs and xboxes really distract from the fact <br>that you are in a prison. The experience of being separated from families, homes, and jobs is still omnipresent regardless of the country. <br>Tours themselves only show the aspects of a prison that officers would like to show - and although the officers of our tour were fairly <br>transparent about the use of more restrictive measures, particularly solitary confinement (something the NCS has been internationally <br>criticized of for their frequent use), there still always is another side. Prison tours themselves happen without the consent of any <br>person incarcerated, and while valuable in my experience to give context to what I read and hear about from inmates, there is not much of <br>a choice involved on their part with my being there.
    <br><br>
    All of this is to say there’s a lot to think about. My project focuses instead on people sentenced through at-home electronic monitoring, <br>rather than in a prison, but understanding the experiences of both are necessary to contextualize how to minimize the structural <br>difficulties people face at the end of their sentence. A lighter post about Scandinavian summer is coming soon, but thought a quick look <br>into what I’m working on was needed :)
