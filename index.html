    <h3> What is this?</h3>
    <p>Hei og velkommen! I've always wanted a terrible html website (à la <a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996/">Space Jam</a> and the <a href="https://www.heavensgate.com/">Heaven's Gate cult</a> - two things commonly referred <br>to in the same sentence) and so here's my attempt to document my year abroad in Norway. Enjoy :D</p>    

    <h3> 8/24/24 </h3>
    <p>
    <p>
    Nothing like a couple mean 13 year olds to really inspire me to pick up the pace learning Norwegian! This week I revived my hockey career as 
    <br>a coach, where I’ll be assisting with two teams, U12 and U13, at a local club this year. Hockey has been such a large part of my life for <br>a long time, and sharing the game in a country where it’s not huge - surprising, given Norwegians love every other winter sport - was one <br>of my biggest goals for this year. 
    <br><br>
    In short, it’s been amazing so far. Stepping back on the ice was easy and natural, and each practice has flown by. But! As I’ve quickly found <br>out, there’s little filter, really ever with the kids, but particularly about my Norwegian accent (or lack thereof). When I’ve tried to <br>use Norwegian words or phrases around my roommates - like mentioning I wanted to go hiking in the nearby area of Akershus - I’ve mostly <br>gotten polite nods or corrections in pronunciation that usually end in a “close enough” after a few mostly futile attempts. With the kids, <br>no such luck. At my last practice, trying to learn the Norwegian words for blue and red (blå and rød), I asked two of the kids on the team <br>for help. After repeating the pronunciation back (blow and rue-uh, but obviously I’m not the authority here), they both looked at each <br>other and laughed. Humbling! A couple minutes later, I got a grimace from another kid when I asked what his name was in Norwegian (one of <br>very few phrases I felt confident about) before he told me my Norwegian didn’t make sense.
    <br><br>
    On another note, it rains here! This is not remotely a surprise after even the most cursory Google search about the climate in Norway, but <br>I am quickly finding out the vast scientific consensus is no lie. I’m used to the type of rain in Arizona, where a storm is just some <br>quirky thing and rarely something that requires a rain jacket or umbrella. Caught in a storm? You might as well stand in it because it’s <br>the last you’re getting for a couple months. Here, you just end up already wet when you reenter the rain a couple hours later. To clarify, <br>I own a very capable rain jacket - I have all the resources at my disposal to avoid getting soaked. But, for whatever reason, when it <br>comes to walking out the door, my years of Arizona residency take over and I leave my apartment exposed to the elements. Anyways, this is <br>how I reached my hockey practice yesterday evening, running the walk from the metro stop to the rink, hockey bag slung over my shoulder <br>and avoiding the large puddles pooling on the mostly gravel path. Survival of the fittest and all that.
    <br><br>
    Otherwise, today marks one week in Norway! It feels like I’ve lived several lifetimes here already, but I’m excited for everything more that’s <br>still to come.

    <h3> 8/21/24 </h3>
    <p>
    It’s a little past noon, and I’m sitting on the second floor of the Oslo public library. The crowd is mixed - students like myself <br>clustered around desks and outlets, kids from school groups in yellow crossing guard vests running outside of the watch of their teachers, <br>and tourists wandering in from the nearby museums to snap a couple pictures before braving the rain once again. It’s an impressive <br>building, even in a city that noticeably dedicates itself to public spaces. Sitting on the harbor, it’s an Oslo landmark along with <br>the nearby opera house (operahuset). But regardless of the place, it’s here that I've come to say I'm nearly a week into my stay in <br>Norway.

    The first few days have been a blur, a mix of ikea stops, tourist sights, and return trips to ikea after realizing that I still don’t actually <br>have bedsheets. This too has been while not knowing much of the language at all - something that's made little things like getting <br>groceries more difficult so far. The time I've spent looking blankly at different brands of greek yogurt is absurd. Fortunately, most <br>people speak good English - particularly close to the city center, which has made asking for help relatively easy. Even still, I'm trying <br>to pick up as much Norwegian as I can, though right now that's mostly limited to hei's (means hi, pronounced the same way) and unnskyld <br>med's (means excuse me, pronounced oon-shill may). It's a work in progress - though I've been assured that Norwegians sometimes can't even <br>understand other Norwegians because some regional dialects are so strong.
    <br><br>
    Yesterday was my first day at KRUS, the University College of the Norwegian Correctional Service, where I’ll be spending my year <br>researching Electronic Monitoring - essentially house arrest - in Norway. Already, the Norwegian approach to corrections is much different <br>than anything I’ve worked with before. Here, the training to become a correctional officer is a two-year program (and may become a three-<br>year bachelor's degree soon), where in addition to practical training students get classes in social work, sociology, philosophy, and <br>criminology. While security is still a primary focus in prison, there's also a much greater emphasis on job training, education, and <br>living in a way that prepares people for life after their release. For one, Norwegian prisoners have a shared kitchen and make their own food, with <br>access to kitchen tools up to and including knives.
    <br><br>
    On one last note, my room is finally starting to look like a place where someone lives! Last night I set up my cork board, something for me <br>that always makes a place a home. It was the first thing I set up in my Barrett dorm, and the last thing I took down moving out from my <br>apartment a couple weeks ago. I’m hoping to add a couple more stickers and postcards as I travel around here, but for now it’s nice to <br>have some reminders of home :)
