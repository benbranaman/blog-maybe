    Jeg gikk på ski! This past week, I completed one of the last major pre-requisites to full Norwegian personhood when I went cross country skiing for the first <br>time. Before I got to Norway, I knew that the sport was one of the country’s favorite pastimes, but in retrospect, I think I somehow still vastly <br>underestimated its cultural impact. Since I have been here, the news, celebrities, and even the work day revolve around skiing and access to skiing.

    Many major ski events are must see TV events. A couple weeks ago, my roommates and I gathered around to watch a biathlon race (the combination of cross county <br>skiing and rifle shooting, obviously, or as said in Norwegian, “skiskyting”) which Norway would lose in dramatic fashion to the Swedish team. On the home <br>stretch the Swedish skier tripped the Norwegian “accidentally” with one of their poles, generating a fair amount of controversy here, especially with the <br>loss coming to Sweden (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uauYrfXMlXc">The video is here</a> - you be the judge). In other areas of Norwegian culture, Norwegian skiers and ski events make up common answers <br>for a lot of Norway’s huge trivia culture, a humbling fact for myself when I try to hang in there with my now useless encyclopedic American sports <br>knowledge - nobody here is interested in past Cy Young winners. The name recognition with skiers even goes to the point that when Rachel visited in <br>December and sat next to a 2017 world championship bronze medalist in the 15km race on the plane (with that race being their only ever individual medal I <br>might add), I mentioned the name to a few of my roommates and people at work and unanimously people knew who the person was. For workdays, I’ve learned <br>that working from home in the winter is shorthand for going skiing all morning, and the gym in my office has a machine that simulates using your poles <br>while skiing. Skiing is also a popular sport at all times a day - with most runs being lit up by streetlights it’s pretty typical to see a run busy most of <br>the night. Even in my incredibly niche world of electronic monitoring, probation officers I’ve talked to have mentioned that public acceptance around EM <br>grew after a major Norwegian skiing star received a criminal charge and was sentenced via EM, allowing them to continue to complete with their ankle <br>bracelet on. It truly bears no understatement. This is a country that loves to ski.
    <br><br>
    However, without skis and with a warmer winter than usual in Oslo so far, I hadn’t gotten the chance to try it out for myself yet. That was before Berit, my <br>research advisor at KRUS, invited me to try skiing with her one evening after work this past week. Fortunately, one of her kids has the same shoe size as <br>me, so I borrowed their equipment for the day and we went up to Linderudkollen, a forest area north of Oslo with cross country skiing runs. Going into the <br>day, I was cautiously optimistic about my own cross country skiing ability. Downhill skiing, as most Norwegians would refer to how most Americans typically <br>ski going down a mountain, came relatively easy to me from my background ice skating when I first learned it. I figured since I was pretty familiar both <br>with the concept of skiing and just the concept of balancing on two narrow things on your feet more generally, I would at least be able to be passable <br>without too much of a problem.
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">
 <table cellspacing="10">
     <tr>
        <td><img src="images/IMG_7174.jpg" alt="google pics 1"></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Not my pictuees - but the Linderudkollen ski runs</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    This was not the case! The differences in the two sports became all too apparent to me once I went tumbling down into the snow two times in my first five <br>minutes on the run. The biggest immediate issue for me was that with cross country skis, your feet are only strapped in to the front of the skis, meaning <br>that you need to lean fairly far forward while moving. However, when I’ve gone skiing downhill, I would often lean back to regain my balance since your <br>feet are strapped in on both your sides to your skis. Doing this, I found out over and over as I tried to fight my skiing instincts, is the fastest way to <br>wipeout while skiing cross country. I did get slightly better as the night went along, improving at falling forward as Berit taught me to move, but the <br>final fall count was at 6 through an hour and a half, and while going down hills I was reduced to skiing full pizza style like I was back in ski school on <br>the bunny slopes.
    <br><br>
    For all my struggles though, between cross country skiing and learning the Norwegian language more generally, I am grateful for my time in Norway as a chance <br>to be really, really, bad at things. It’s not often outside of this experience that I’ve recently gotten to be a complete beginner at something , and it <br>does challenge me to keep going when I’m not immediately good and enjoy the small victories that come with slowly getting better. It was definitely <br>humbling to be the worst skier on the slopes, especially in front of someone who I had told I had experience downhill skiing to (and who was probably <br>wondering if I had been lying this whole time about there being snow in Arizona after seeing me fall once again). It’s also humbling to feel like I’m <br>understanding more and more Norwegian and then stumble when someone asks me “hvordan går det” (how are you) in the office. To make my own Yogism, with <br>Norwegian I’m more often remembering all the things I forgot. But, at the same time, it’s gratifying when my roommates show me some video in Norwegian and <br>I understand what they’re talking about, and even in skiing, there were still small victories like when I made it down a hill for the first time without <br>falling.
    <br><br>
    In terms of my skiing redemption, fortunately the Fulbright program has a ski weekend in a couple weeks where I can embarrass myself in front of people I at <br>least don’t see every day at work, so I’m looking forward to getting skis on once again soon! My roommate Peik also wants to teach me the “skating” <br>technique for skiing, different the more traditional “walking” technique that Berit taught me (Side note, but this technique is baked into how Norwegians <br>say they’re going skiing! Saying you’re going skiing, or “Jeg går på ski”, literally translates to “I’m walking on skis”). Even when it’s with fun <br>activities like skiing, feeling out of your element is definitely part of the challenge of moving to a new country sometimes, but it’s still a feeling I’m <br>very happy to get to experience :)

    <h3> 1/21/25</h3>
    <p>
    Nytt år samme meg kanskje. I’ve spent two weeks back in Oslo since my brief return to the states over the holidays, and in some ways, the vestiges of a winter <br>past are starting to rear their head. The festive lights that had dotted the city since early November have been put away for the time being, and the <br>darkness, though still omnipresent, is receding. On my morning train rides to work, I’m even now getting glimpses of the sunrise before 9am. 
    <br><br>
    Of course, while in some ways winter is flying by, at other times I’m very aware of what exactly living at the 60th parallel entails. A common refrain I had <br>while back in Phoenix was that through my first few months in Norway, I realized that I actually liked cold weather. Before I moved, I always thought I <br>did, and felt that especially growing up around an ice rink I had a greater tolerance to the cold, only rivaled maybe by a 12-year-old unwilling admit <br>they might need a sweatshirt in the morning. And while I had never experienced weather like what’s common in Norway, my experiences in Oslo through <br>November and December in and around 20 degrees Fahrenheit confirmed to me I liked bundling up and embracing the cold. I even got in a few runs in around <br>the 20 degree mark and came out mostly unscathed, and to this day (majorly knocking on wood here) I have not slipped and fell on any of the ice around the <br>city. But, to put it delicately, my first week back made me eat my words.
    <br><br>
    I was welcomed back into the fray at a cool clip of 7 degrees, and within my first 24 hours the temperature had bottomed out around 4. When the winter was <br>first approaching, I had internally prepared by trying to log how many layers of clothing I needed at each successive level of cold. 35 degrees warrants a <br>puffer jacket, 30 degrees gloves, the high 20s long underwear, and the mid to low 20s additionally a scarf. In times of desperation and the few days in <br>which the weather dipped into the teens in December, I also had beanies and thicker gloves to lean on. What I’ve found out about single digits is that, <br>much like the 110s in Phoenix, at some point there’s really a limit to what else you can do besides staying inside. I attempted a run when things were at <br>the 7 or 8 degree mark and found out there is a level of cold in which your lungs do just start to hurt. The more you know! Unfortunately too, I have been <br>informed there isn’t any prophet-like figure like Punxsutawney Phil to give me the heads up on end of the season, so for the time being I’m assuming this <br>will be lasting all the way through most of March. 
    <br><br>
    Adding to that weather shock is the fact that between Monday and Tuesday last week, Oslo got over a foot of snow, and in some areas a outside of the city like <br>Lillestrøm, where my office is, the amount was closer to two feet. Particularly on Tuesday, the snowflakes were larger than anything I’d seen before, and <br>the combination of the cold and snow resulted in a series of events that I easily could have foreseen, but stumbled into nonetheless. Monday night, as the <br>snow was first picking up, I needed a quick run to the grocery store having finally overcome my jet lag from the trip a few days prior. But, since I also <br>wanted to grab a quick dinner for the next day because my weekly Norwegian class was scheduled to be virtual and I was planning on logging in from my <br>office, I decided to take the longer walk, a little under 15 minutes, to the larger grocery store further north of my apartment. Upon taking my first step <br>out the door, several things all started to simultaneously occur.
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">
 <table cellspacing="10">
     <tr>
        <td><img src="images/IMG_6905.jpg" alt="work view"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>The snow has also meant a nicer view from my office!</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    Immediately, I began to pay my penance for my lack of hood, or any type of face covering at all, save a scarf that I did eventually figure out how to wear <br>after making my way through a WikiHow article (actually very helpful). First, my forehead started to go numb, a feeling that I was not aware existed until <br>it began. The wind at this time was also beginning to pick up, giving me the great privilege of walking directly into the onslaught of snow pouring down. <br>Pretty quickly, the snowflakes that had lodged themselves into my mustache began to freeze and fuse together, which give a small of dose of foreshadowing <br>for what was to occur to the rest of my hair minutes later. I’m sure if someone was to pass me on the street at this point they might have offered some <br>remark or possibly advice to get in the market for some better winter gear. The unfortunate part then would be that I wouldn’t have been able to answer, <br>since the next thing to go was a growing numbness in my lips. All this is to stay as I trudged up the few steps up and into the foyer of the grocery <br>store, I became plainly aware of all the other patrons who did not have their hair fused together in one icy block. Through some degree of typical <br>Norwegian non-confrontation, my state of affairs was not a topic of conversation as I reached the checkout counter, but the extra glances I received were <br>loud enough. Fortunately, the return journey was with the wind and snow at my back, though my hair still largely met the same fate before I mercifully <br>scrambled back up the stairs to my apartment. To add insult to injury, my virtual class the next evening was canceled since the snow had trapped my <br>professor in their cabin up north without their teaching materials, rendering my journey mostly as just as some sort of hard-love character building <br>exercise.

    Though my first introduction to snow here started on a somewhat rough note, I got some redemption the following weekend when I started my Norwegian winter <br>sports career. Saturday was a perfect winter’s day, sunny and in the mid 20s, and with December being a little warmer than usual, it was obvious all the <br>locals were itching to hit the slopes. Owing to Oslo’s fantastic public transit system, the subway has stops all the way up to (cross country) skiing <br>trails a little outside the city, and as a result, when I first stepped into the subway car from the middle of the city that morning, it was already <br>filled with people of all ages almost exclusively carrying skis. As an aside, one of my coworkers recently mentioned to me he had gone out skiing with his <br>three-year-old, and this is not an uncommon occurrence. The adage goes that Norwegians are born on skis, and though the country’s low c-section rate <br>doesn’t seem to support this theory, I’m inclined to agree.
    <br><br>
    That afternoon though, it was sledding that one of my fellow Fulbrighters and I were after, and we took the t-bane up to Korketrekkeren, a 2 kilometer-long <br>sledding trail that actually begins and ends at different subway stops along a mountain, so you can take public transit right back to the top of the hill. <br>This trail though was a little more extreme than any sort of plastic disc-type sledding I’d done before in Flagstaff or the like. Instead, the sled was <br>wooden and had more of a toboggan-type of design, with a rope you held that you could pull to increase your speed while digging your heels into the snow <br>to steer. With a steeper incline, it was pretty easy to build up speed, and along the trail, the sledding tracks of others before created makeshift ramps <br>to navigate up and around on the journey. There also were several sharp corners, leading to some ugly wipeouts ahead of me and subsequent cries of <br>“forsiktig” (for-sheik-tea, careful in Norwegian) from those already sprawled across the snow. The entire thing was a blast, and I’m looking forward to <br>the next snow storm so I can go back.

    This was a little bit of a longer update since it took me awhile to get this all up and going again, but already there’s a lot more to share now that I’ve <br>officially crossed the halfway point (!!!) of my time here. Ha det for nå!

    <h3> 12/14/24</h3>
    <p>
    I’m just five days out from ending my first semester (if you can call it that - my brain is still wired on the school calendar) in Norway. I’m excited to be <br>home and see everyone I’ve missed and have things be familiar for a bit, but I’m also excited to continue my time here in the new year and learn more <br>about life in this country. There continue to be new wrinkles and traditions I learn about each week. Yesterday was Saint Lucy’s Day, a holiday I did not <br>know existed until it was almost over. It celebrates Saint Lucy, or Lucia, who was given sainthood for her efforts in the fourth century to bring food <br>and other supplies to Christians hiding from religious persecution from Romans before she was eventually captured and killed herself. According to legend <br>she traveled through the night with a candle on her head so she could carry more food in her hands, and with the day also falling close to the winter <br>equinox the day is celebrated as a festival of light. Strangely, Scandinavia is the only region in the world that celebrates this holiday (with the major <br>exception of the island nation of Saint Lucia, for obvious reasons) and despite its religious nature, these celebrations also take place in schools and <br>in the workplace. I was working from home yesterday, not knowing what I was missing out on, but my office had a candle lighting ceremony and people baked <br>saffron buns, the traditional food of Saint Lucy’s Day. I didn’t totally miss out on the celebration though, as after my hockey practices in the evening <br>one parent came in with their own homemade saffron buns for the team. 
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">

    This close tie of religion to everyday traditions is something that is fairly common in Norway, which is particularly interesting given Norway’s relatively <br>liberal values and the fact that, by and large, Norway isn’t really a church-going country. Only about 5% of Norwegians attend a religious ceremony each <br>week, compared to one poll that puts the US at around 42%. Despite this, Norway has an official state religion (Lutheran Protestantism), and an official <br>Church of Norway that the King of Norway presided over until 2012, and the Church remained under the jurisdiction of the government until 2017 when it <br>became a separate organization. So, despite the current disinterest in church-going, holiday traditions commonly take a religious form, such as in <br>schools where one of my roommates shared with me it’s common to attend a church service together with your class before leaving for winter break. The <br>country’s ties to religion is another element that reflects the fact that for a long time, Norway has been a pretty homogenous society, and until very <br>recently, there haven’t been too many large religious minorities. In many ways, the acceptance of a new, more diverse, Norway defines many of the <br>challenges the country faces going forward.
    <br><br>
    In non-Norwegian news, last week I attended the Confederation of European Probation’s Electronic Monitoring conference, which is to say I really roughed it <br>up on a beach in Portugal for a few days while basking in the 70 degrees and sunny weather, a full 40 degrees warmer than what I was missing back in <br>Oslo. The experience was an interesting one, in the sense both that I got a better understanding of the criminal justice landscape in Europe, and also <br>that I was acting both as a representative of the US and as a representative of Norway. The contradiction of being an American in a Norway name tag for <br>one caused a lot of language confusion - I was immensely disappointing to Swedes who came up to me speaking Swedish only to realize I didn’t understand a <br>word they were saying, and also pleasantly surprising to Brits who complimented me on how good my English was (thanks, I’d hope so). 
    <br><br>
    Attendees were from all corners of the justice system - some people were researchers like me, and others were politicians, judges, correctional officers, <br>probation workers, attorneys, and about everything in between. Though I was a little nervous about attending without really knowing anyone there, I found <br>these shared experiences made chatting with strangers a lot easier, and networking came a lot more naturally to me when I was talking about something I <br>actually cared about than other career events I had ever attended. Comparing the approaches to justice between countries was the main area of interest <br>for the week though, especially with Norway considered such an international leader in the area. In some ways, I did feel that Norway had an approach I <br>preferred to other countries. For one, while part of the conference discussed advanced technology to use to track people incarcerated through EM or other <br>people of interest, it was primarily the Scandinavian delegation that voiced concerns about not using more invasive technology than was necessary for <br>public safety, and reducing stigma when possible. There were even some talks from the Norwegian constituents to have ankle bracelets used for Electronic <br>Monitoring go on the wrist and have the appearance of a watch, to hopefully reduce the stigma people feel going into public wearing an ankle bracelet.

        <td><b>The Portuguese coastline, truly roughing it</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    However, there were other topics in the conference that illustrated areas in which the Scandinavian countries are less humane than other European systems. <br>Unlike the US, jails or temporary holding centers aren’t really a thing for people who have been charged with a crime but are still awaiting their trial. <br>Typically people are either let go until their trial in low-risk situations, or are put into the same prison they would be in if they were convicted <br>temporarily, typically in a separate pre-trial detention wing. In Scandinavia, where fears that a person may tamper with evidence pre-trial are much <br>greater than other countries, this will even mean keeping people in solitary confinement for long periods of time before their trial. In cases like <br>these, or when the conditions of pre-trial prison wings aren’t any different to other areas of the prison, this system doesn’t particularly respect the <br>presumption of innocent until proven guilty that is supposed to be the basis for justice systems. The conference discussed EM as a possible alternative <br>to these high rates of pre-trial detention, and I think if implemented correctly could be a positive development for Norway to take away.
    <br><br>
    This might be my last Norway update until after the holidays, so for the time being God Jul and Godt Nytt År! Excited to see what Norway brings me in 2025 :)
