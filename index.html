    <p>
    Nytt år samme meg kanskje. I’ve spent two weeks back in Oslo since my brief return to the states over the holidays, and in some ways, the vestiges of a winter <br>past are starting to rear their head. The festive lights that had dotted the city since early November have been put away for the time being, and the <br>darkness, though still omnipresent, is receding. On my morning train rides to work, I’m even now getting glimpses of the sunrise before 9am. 
    <br><br>
    Of course, while in some ways winter is flying by, at other times I’m very aware of what exactly living at the 60th parallel entails. A common refrain I had <br>while back in Phoenix was that through my first few months in Norway, I realized that I actually liked cold weather. Before I moved, I always thought I <br>did, and felt that especially growing up around an ice rink I had a greater tolerance to the cold, only rivaled maybe by a 12-year-old unwilling admit <br>they might need a sweatshirt in the morning. And while I had never experienced weather like what’s common in Norway, my experiences in Oslo through <br>November and December in and around 20 degrees Fahrenheit confirmed to me I liked bundling up and embracing the cold. I even got in a few runs in around <br>the 20 degree mark and came out mostly unscathed, and to this day (majorly knocking on wood here) I have not slipped and fell on any of the ice around the <br>city. But, to put it delicately, my first week back made me eat my words.
    <br><br>
    I was welcomed back into the fray at a cool clip of 7 degrees, and within my first 24 hours the temperature had bottomed out around 4. When the winter was <br>first approaching, I had internally prepared by trying to log how many layers of clothing I needed at each successive level of cold. 35 degrees warrants a <br>puffer jacket, 30 degrees gloves, the high 20s long underwear, and the mid to low 20s additionally a scarf. In times of desperation and the few days in <br>which the weather dipped into the teens in December, I also had beanies and thicker gloves to lean on. What I’ve found out about single digits is that, <br>much like the 110s in Phoenix, at some point there’s really a limit to what else you can do besides staying inside. I attempted a run when things were at <br>the 7 or 8 degree mark and found out there is a level of cold in which your lungs do just start to hurt. The more you know! Unfortunately too, I have been <br>informed there isn’t any prophet-like figure like Punxsutawney Phil to give me the heads up on end of the season, so for the time being I’m assuming this <br>will be lasting all the way through most of March. 
    <br><br>
    Adding to that weather shock is the fact that between Monday and Tuesday last week, Oslo got over a foot of snow, and in some areas a outside of the city like <br>Lillestrøm, where my office is, the amount was closer to two feet. Particularly on Tuesday, the snowflakes were larger than anything I’d seen before, and <br>the combination of the cold and snow resulted in a series of events that I easily could have foreseen, but stumbled into nonetheless. Monday night, as the <br>snow was first picking up, I needed a quick run to the grocery store having finally overcome my jet lag from the trip a few days prior. But, since I also <br>wanted to grab a quick dinner for the next day because my weekly Norwegian class was scheduled to be virtual and I was planning on logging in from my <br>office, I decided to take the longer walk, a little under 15 minutes, to the larger grocery store further north of my apartment. Upon taking my first step <br>out the door, several things all started to simultaneously occur.
    <br></p><p style="font-size: 12px;">
 <table cellspacing="10">
     <tr>
        <td><img src="images/IMG_6905.jpg" alt="work view"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>The snow has also meant a nicer view from my office!</b></td>
    </tr>
</table></p><p>
    Immediately, I began to pay my penance for my lack of hood, or any type of face covering at all, save a scarf that I did eventually figure out how to wear <br>after making my way through a WikiHow article (actually very helpful). First, my forehead started to go numb, a feeling that I was not aware existed until <br>it began. The wind at this time was also beginning to pick up, giving me the great privilege of walking directly into the onslaught of snow pouring down. <br>Pretty quickly, the snowflakes that had lodged themselves into my mustache began to freeze and fuse together, which give a small of dose of foreshadowing <br>for what was to occur to the rest of my hair minutes later. I’m sure if someone was to pass me on the street at this point they might have offered some <br>remark or possibly advice to get in the market for some better winter gear. The unfortunate part then would be that I wouldn’t have been able to answer, <br>since the next thing to go was a growing numbness in my lips. All this is to stay as I trudged up the few steps up and into the foyer of the grocery <br>store, I became plainly aware of all the other patrons who did not have their hair fused together in one icy block. Through some degree of typical <br>Norwegian non-confrontation, my state of affairs was not a topic of conversation as I reached the checkout counter, but the extra glances I received were <br>loud enough. Fortunately, the return journey was with the wind and snow at my back, though my hair still largely met the same fate before I mercifully <br>scrambled back up the stairs to my apartment. To add insult to injury, my virtual class the next evening was canceled since the snow had trapped my <br>professor in their cabin up north without their teaching materials, rendering my journey mostly as just as some sort of hard-love character building <br>exercise.

    Though my first introduction to snow here started on a somewhat rough note, I got some redemption the following weekend when I started my Norwegian winter <br>sports career. Saturday was a perfect winter’s day, sunny and in the mid 20s, and with December being a little warmer than usual, it was obvious all the <br>locals were itching to hit the slopes. Owing to Oslo’s fantastic public transit system, the subway has stops all the way up to (cross country) skiing <br>trails a little outside the city, and as a result, when I first stepped into the subway car from the middle of the city that morning, it was already <br>filled with people of all ages almost exclusively carrying skis. As an aside, one of my coworkers recently mentioned to me he had gone out skiing with his <br>three-year-old, and this is not an uncommon occurrence. The adage goes that Norwegians are born on skis, and though the country’s low c-section rate <br>doesn’t seem to support this theory, I’m inclined to agree.
    <br><br>
    That afternoon though, it was sledding that one of my fellow Fulbrighters and I were after, and we took the t-bane up to Korketrekkeren, a 2 kilometer-long <br>sledding trail that actually begins and ends at different subway stops along a mountain, so you can take public transit right back to the top of the hill. <br>This trail though was a little more extreme than any sort of plastic disc-type sledding I’d done before in Flagstaff or the like. Instead, the sled was <br>wooden and had more of a toboggan-type of design, with a rope you held that you could pull to increase your speed while digging your heels into the snow <br>to steer. With a steeper incline, it was pretty easy to build up speed, and along the trail, the sledding tracks of others before created makeshift ramps <br>to navigate up and around on the journey. There also were several sharp corners, leading to some ugly wipeouts ahead of me and subsequent cries of <br>“forsiktig” (for-sheik-tea, careful in Norwegian) from those already sprawled across the snow. The entire thing was a blast, and I’m looking forward to <br>the next snow storm so I can go back.

    This was a little bit of a longer update since it took me awhile to get this all up and going again, but already there’s a lot more to share now that I’ve <br>officially crossed the halfway point (!!!) of my time here. Ha det for nå!

    <h3> 12/14/24</h3>
    <p>
    I’m just five days out from ending my first semester (if you can call it that - my brain is still wired on the school calendar) in Norway. I’m excited to be <br>home and see everyone I’ve missed and have things be familiar for a bit, but I’m also excited to continue my time here in the new year and learn more <br>about life in this country. There continue to be new wrinkles and traditions I learn about each week. Yesterday was Saint Lucy’s Day, a holiday I did not <br>know existed until it was almost over. It celebrates Saint Lucy, or Lucia, who was given sainthood for her efforts in the fourth century to bring food <br>and other supplies to Christians hiding from religious persecution from Romans before she was eventually captured and killed herself. According to legend <br>she traveled through the night with a candle on her head so she could carry more food in her hands, and with the day also falling close to the winter <br>equinox the day is celebrated as a festival of light. Strangely, Scandinavia is the only region in the world that celebrates this holiday (with the major <br>exception of the island nation of Saint Lucia, for obvious reasons) and despite its religious nature, these celebrations also take place in schools and <br>in the workplace. I was working from home yesterday, not knowing what I was missing out on, but my office had a candle lighting ceremony and people baked <br>saffron buns, the traditional food of Saint Lucy’s Day. I didn’t totally miss out on the celebration though, as after my hockey practices in the evening <br>one parent came in with their own homemade saffron buns for the team.

    This close tie of religion to everyday traditions is something that is fairly common in Norway, which is particularly interesting given Norway’s relatively <br>liberal values and the fact that, by and large, Norway isn’t really a church-going country. Only about 5% of Norwegians attend a religious ceremony each <br>week, compared to one poll that puts the US at around 42%. Despite this, Norway has an official state religion (Lutheran Protestantism), and an official <br>Church of Norway that the King of Norway presided over until 2012, and the Church remained under the jurisdiction of the government until 2017 when it <br>became a separate organization. So, despite the current disinterest in church-going, holiday traditions commonly take a religious form, such as in <br>schools where one of my roommates shared with me it’s common to attend a church service together with your class before leaving for winter break. The <br>country’s ties to religion is another element that reflects the fact that for a long time, Norway has been a pretty homogenous society, and until very <br>recently, there haven’t been too many large religious minorities. In many ways, the acceptance of a new, more diverse, Norway defines many of the <br>challenges the country faces going forward.
    <br><br>
    In non-Norwegian news, last week I attended the Confederation of European Probation’s Electronic Monitoring conference, which is to say I really roughed it <br>up on a beach in Portugal for a few days while basking in the 70 degrees and sunny weather, a full 40 degrees warmer than what I was missing back in <br>Oslo. The experience was an interesting one, in the sense both that I got a better understanding of the criminal justice landscape in Europe, and also <br>that I was acting both as a representative of the US and as a representative of Norway. The contradiction of being an American in a Norway name tag for <br>one caused a lot of language confusion - I was immensely disappointing to Swedes who came up to me speaking Swedish only to realize I didn’t understand a <br>word they were saying, and also pleasantly surprising to Brits who complimented me on how good my English was (thanks, I’d hope so). 
    <br><br>
    Attendees were from all corners of the justice system - some people were researchers like me, and others were politicians, judges, correctional officers, <br>probation workers, attorneys, and about everything in between. Though I was a little nervous about attending without really knowing anyone there, I found <br>these shared experiences made chatting with strangers a lot easier, and networking came a lot more naturally to me when I was talking about something I <br>actually cared about than other career events I had ever attended. Comparing the approaches to justice between countries was the main area of interest <br>for the week though, especially with Norway considered such an international leader in the area. In some ways, I did feel that Norway had an approach I <br>preferred to other countries. For one, while part of the conference discussed advanced technology to use to track people incarcerated through EM or other <br>people of interest, it was primarily the Scandinavian delegation that voiced concerns about not using more invasive technology than was necessary for <br>public safety, and reducing stigma when possible. There were even some talks from the Norwegian constituents to have ankle bracelets used for Electronic <br>Monitoring go on the wrist and have the appearance of a watch, to hopefully reduce the stigma people feel going into public wearing an ankle bracelet.

        <td><b>The Portuguese coastline, truly roughing it</b></td>

</table></p><p>
    However, there were other topics in the conference that illustrated areas in which the Scandinavian countries are less humane than other European systems. <br>Unlike the US, jails or temporary holding centers aren’t really a thing for people who have been charged with a crime but are still awaiting their trial. <br>Typically people are either let go until their trial in low-risk situations, or are put into the same prison they would be in if they were convicted <br>temporarily, typically in a separate pre-trial detention wing. In Scandinavia, where fears that a person may tamper with evidence pre-trial are much <br>greater than other countries, this will even mean keeping people in solitary confinement for long periods of time before their trial. In cases like <br>these, or when the conditions of pre-trial prison wings aren’t any different to other areas of the prison, this system doesn’t particularly respect the <br>presumption of innocent until proven guilty that is supposed to be the basis for justice systems. The conference discussed EM as a possible alternative <br>to these high rates of pre-trial detention, and I think if implemented correctly could be a positive development for Norway to take away.
    <br><br>
    This might be my last Norway update until after the holidays, so for the time being God Jul and Godt Nytt År! Excited to see what Norway brings me in 2025 :)

    <h3> 11/24/24</h3>
    <p>
    There’s one word that in my time in Norway has reigned supreme. It is the ultimate compliment, the aspiration for all things, and even a philosophy of life <br>depending on who you ask. The word is ‘koselig’ (pronunciation is kose - think ‘close’ without the ‘l’ - eh - lee) and if you take the Google translation <br>of it meaning ‘cozy’ at face value, you’re barely scratching the surface. Unlike its more literal equivalent, koselig is rarely just about physical items <br>or environments. A person can be koselig, an experience can be koselig, and as mentioned before, koselig can also be a frame of mind. So what does <br>koselig mean then? Well, to continue to hijack reddit to explain Norwegian phenomena, one person (who gives their own take on koselig <a href="https://afroginthefjord.com/2014/02/02/how-to-make-things-koselig/?v=0b3b97fa6688">in this blog</a>) <br>describes the state of koselig “like an inner summer that Norwegians create for themselves to feel like it’s warm all year long no matter the <br>circumstances”. In my (less eloquent) telling, koselig describes a kind of intimacy, and particularly one that describes finding beauty in simplicity. In <br>other words, it’s something that feels comfortable and natural without a lot of effort, which is the meaning in which koselig is often applied to <br>feelings and friendships. I’ve been told that telling someone that their house is koselig is the nicest thing you can say in Norwegian culture, and to be <br>told after hanging out with someone that they had a kjempe (similar meaning to ‘very’ or ‘super’) koselig time is an unofficial barometer that you are <br>officially friends. 
    <br><br>
    For many Norwegians, winter is the ideal climate to really embrace a koselig time. It’s much more common to take an extended vacation over the holidays here <br>(I’m leaving back to the US on the 19th and think I’ll be one of the only people in my office that last week), and families will often spend some of that <br>time in a cabin up in the mountains where the itinerary typically includes cross country skiing, spending time with family, and reading (side note, but <br>Norway has a massive reading culture. It’s an unofficial national tradition to read mystery books over Easter, something I’ve very ready to see for <br>myself in person). To ward off the early darkness, plenty of blankets and candles are a given, along with the traditional Norwegian fish and lamb dishes <br>that are almost exclusively eaten around Christmastime. 
    <br><br>
    So, how have I been getting koselig then? Well, in line with the Norwegian reading culture, the early darkness has turned me into quite a lesehest (literal <br>translation reading (lese) horse (hest), but a Norwegian word for an avid reader). The public library continues to be one of my favorite spaces in the <br>city and save for my many trials duking it out for a table or reading spot, because as it turns out, I am not the first one to discover the place, it <br>remains a great place to watch the last minutes of daylight eke out over the fjord and to watch working, reading, and procrastinating Oslofolk bustling <br>about. My current is called Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World (you will never guess what it’s about), which I promise is significantly <br>more interesting than it sounds!! The first chapters have been about how learning to salt and preserve cod were a large reason Vikings were able to sail <br>to North America before the rest of Europe so I’ve appreciated the bits of Norwegian history I’ve gotten out of it. The cod book is quickly joining <br>another title I read a couple years back, The Book of Eels, on my proverbial maritime Mount Rushmore, though I’m still taking applications for the other <br>two spots.
    <br><br>
    In other traditional koselig practices, Cameron visited this past week and we embarked on my first Scandinavian sauna experience. Located right on the waters <br>of the fjord opposite the library, the sauna makes you forget in seconds your shivering through 30 degree temperatures (plus a nice sea breeze) on the <br>walk over. That is, until you follow through with the next essential part of the fjord experience: jumping into the 40ish degree fjord. Then, no matter <br>how burning hot you were feeling seconds prior, your fight or flight instincts kick in immediately upon breaking the surface of the water, and it’s a <br>frantic struggle getting up the ladder and back into the warm confines of your cubical wooden refuge. But still, if there’s anything to learn from that <br>type of homeostasis whiplash, it’s that koselig is hardly limited to warm-inducing activities. In a related freezing vein, this morning was our first <br>real snowstorm of the year (we’ve had very brief snows previously but this was the first one that really stuck), and to welcome in the occasion I was <br>able to go on a nice run along the water and welcome in the oncoming winter - another experience that while warming to the heart was cold to particularly <br>my fingers and toes.

    This next week though, my discovery of what all constitutes koselig will be at least temporarily delayed, since I’m turning in the weather in the high teens <br>and low twenties for the significantly warmer airs of Portugal where I’ll be attending the European electronic monitoring conference as part of my <br>research. So, stay tuned for a non-Norway post coming from me soon, and in the meantime, I’ll be introducing my roommates to America’s own entry to the <br>koselig cannon: the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving and Christmas specials.
