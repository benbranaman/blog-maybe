    I’m just five days out from ending my first semester (if you can call it that - my brain is still wired on the school calendar) in Norway. I’m excited to be <br>home and see everyone I’ve missed and have things be familiar for a bit, but I’m also excited to continue my time here in the new year and learn more <br>about life in this country. There continue to be new wrinkles and traditions I learn about each week. Yesterday was Saint Lucy’s Day, a holiday I did not <br>know existed until it was almost over. It celebrates Saint Lucy, or Lucia, who was given sainthood for her efforts in the fourth century to bring food <br>and other supplies to Christians hiding from religious persecution from Romans before she was eventually captured and killed herself. According to legend <br>she traveled through the night with a candle on her head so she could carry more food in her hands, and with the day also falling close to the winter <br>equinox the day is celebrated as a festival of light. Strangely, Scandinavia is the only region in the world that celebrates this holiday (with the major <br>exception of the island nation of Saint Lucia, for obvious reasons) and despite its religious nature, these celebrations also take place in schools and <br>in the workplace. I was working from home yesterday, not knowing what I was missing out on, but my office had a candle lighting ceremony and people baked <br>saffron buns, the traditional food of Saint Lucy’s Day. I didn’t totally miss out on the celebration though, as after my hockey practices in the evening <br>one parent came in with their own homemade saffron buns for the team.

    This close tie of religion to everyday traditions is something that is fairly common in Norway, which is particularly interesting given Norway’s relatively <br>liberal values and the fact that, by and large, Norway isn’t really a church-going country. Only about 5% of Norwegians attend a religious ceremony each <br>week, compared to one poll that puts the US at around 42%. Despite this, Norway has an official state religion (Lutheran Protestantism), and an official <br>Church of Norway that the King of Norway presided over until 2012, and the Church remained under the jurisdiction of the government until 2017 when it <br>became a separate organization. So, despite the current disinterest in church-going, holiday traditions commonly take a religious form, such as in <br>schools where one of my roommates shared with me it’s common to attend a church service together with your class before leaving for winter break. The <br>country’s ties to religion is another element that reflects the fact that for a long time, Norway has been a pretty homogenous society, and until very <br>recently, there haven’t been too many large religious minorities. In many ways, the acceptance of a new, more diverse, Norway defines many of the <br>challenges the country faces going forward.
    <br><br>
    In non-Norwegian news, last week I attended the Confederation of European Probation’s Electronic Monitoring conference, which is to say I really roughed it <br>up on a beach in Portugal for a few days while basking in the 70 degrees and sunny weather, a full 40 degrees warmer than what I was missing back in <br>Oslo. The experience was an interesting one, in the sense both that I got a better understanding of the criminal justice landscape in Europe, and also <br>that I was acting both as a representative of the US and as a representative of Norway. The contradiction of being an American in a Norway name tag for <br>one caused a lot of language confusion - I was immensely disappointing to Swedes who came up to me speaking Swedish only to realize I didn’t understand a <br>word they were saying, and also pleasantly surprising to Brits who complimented me on how good my English was (thanks, I’d hope so). 
    <br><br>
    Attendees were from all corners of the justice system - some people were researchers like me, and others were politicians, judges, correctional officers, <br>probation workers, attorneys, and about everything in between. Though I was a little nervous about attending without really knowing anyone there, I found <br>these shared experiences made chatting with strangers a lot easier, and networking came a lot more naturally to me when I was talking about something I <br>actually cared about than other career events I had ever attended. Comparing the approaches to justice between countries was the main area of interest <br>for the week though, especially with Norway considered such an international leader in the area. In some ways, I did feel that Norway had an approach I <br>preferred to other countries. For one, while part of the conference discussed advanced technology to use to track people incarcerated through EM or other <br>people of interest, it was primarily the Scandinavian delegation that voiced concerns about not using more invasive technology than was necessary for <br>public safety, and reducing stigma when possible. There were even some talks from the Norwegian constituents to have ankle bracelets used for Electronic <br>Monitoring go on the wrist and have the appearance of a watch, to hopefully reduce the stigma people feel going into public wearing an ankle bracelet.

    However, there were other topics in the conference that illustrated areas in which the Scandinavian countries are less humane than other European systems. <br>Unlike the US, jails or temporary holding centers aren’t really a thing for people who have been charged with a crime but are still awaiting their trial. <br>Typically people are either let go until their trial in low-risk situations, or are put into the same prison they would be in if they were convicted <br>temporarily, typically in a separate pre-trial detention wing. In Scandinavia, where fears that a person may tamper with evidence pre-trial are much <br>greater than other countries, this will even mean keeping people in solitary confinement for long periods of time before their trial. In cases like <br>these, or when the conditions of pre-trial prison wings aren’t any different to other areas of the prison, this system doesn’t particularly respect the <br>presumption of innocent until proven guilty that is supposed to be the basis for justice systems. The conference discussed EM as a possible alternative <br>to these high rates of pre-trial detention, and I think if implemented correctly could be a positive development for Norway to take away.
    <br><br>
    This might be my last Norway update until after the holidays, so for the time being God Jul and Godt Nytt År! Excited to see what Norway brings me in 2025 :)

    <h3> 11/24/24</h3>
    <p>
    There’s one word that in my time in Norway has reigned supreme. It is the ultimate compliment, the aspiration for all things, and even a philosophy of life <br>depending on who you ask. The word is ‘koselig’ (pronunciation is kose - think ‘close’ without the ‘l’ - eh - lee) and if you take the Google translation <br>of it meaning ‘cozy’ at face value, you’re barely scratching the surface. Unlike its more literal equivalent, koselig is rarely just about physical items <br>or environments. A person can be koselig, an experience can be koselig, and as mentioned before, koselig can also be a frame of mind. So what does <br>koselig mean then? Well, to continue to hijack reddit to explain Norwegian phenomena, one person (who gives their own take on koselig <a href="https://afroginthefjord.com/2014/02/02/how-to-make-things-koselig/?v=0b3b97fa6688">in this blog</a>) <br>describes the state of koselig “like an inner summer that Norwegians create for themselves to feel like it’s warm all year long no matter the <br>circumstances”. In my (less eloquent) telling, koselig describes a kind of intimacy, and particularly one that describes finding beauty in simplicity. In <br>other words, it’s something that feels comfortable and natural without a lot of effort, which is the meaning in which koselig is often applied to <br>feelings and friendships. I’ve been told that telling someone that their house is koselig is the nicest thing you can say in Norwegian culture, and to be <br>told after hanging out with someone that they had a kjempe (similar meaning to ‘very’ or ‘super’) koselig time is an unofficial barometer that you are <br>officially friends. 
    <br><br>
    For many Norwegians, winter is the ideal climate to really embrace a koselig time. It’s much more common to take an extended vacation over the holidays here <br>(I’m leaving back to the US on the 19th and think I’ll be one of the only people in my office that last week), and families will often spend some of that <br>time in a cabin up in the mountains where the itinerary typically includes cross country skiing, spending time with family, and reading (side note, but <br>Norway has a massive reading culture. It’s an unofficial national tradition to read mystery books over Easter, something I’ve very ready to see for <br>myself in person). To ward off the early darkness, plenty of blankets and candles are a given, along with the traditional Norwegian fish and lamb dishes <br>that are almost exclusively eaten around Christmastime. 
    <br><br>
    So, how have I been getting koselig then? Well, in line with the Norwegian reading culture, the early darkness has turned me into quite a lesehest (literal <br>translation reading (lese) horse (hest), but a Norwegian word for an avid reader). The public library continues to be one of my favorite spaces in the <br>city and save for my many trials duking it out for a table or reading spot, because as it turns out, I am not the first one to discover the place, it <br>remains a great place to watch the last minutes of daylight eke out over the fjord and to watch working, reading, and procrastinating Oslofolk bustling <br>about. My current is called Cod: A Biography of the Fish that Changed the World (you will never guess what it’s about), which I promise is significantly <br>more interesting than it sounds!! The first chapters have been about how learning to salt and preserve cod were a large reason Vikings were able to sail <br>to North America before the rest of Europe so I’ve appreciated the bits of Norwegian history I’ve gotten out of it. The cod book is quickly joining <br>another title I read a couple years back, The Book of Eels, on my proverbial maritime Mount Rushmore, though I’m still taking applications for the other <br>two spots.
    <br><br>
    In other traditional koselig practices, Cameron visited this past week and we embarked on my first Scandinavian sauna experience. Located right on the waters <br>of the fjord opposite the library, the sauna makes you forget in seconds your shivering through 30 degree temperatures (plus a nice sea breeze) on the <br>walk over. That is, until you follow through with the next essential part of the fjord experience: jumping into the 40ish degree fjord. Then, no matter <br>how burning hot you were feeling seconds prior, your fight or flight instincts kick in immediately upon breaking the surface of the water, and it’s a <br>frantic struggle getting up the ladder and back into the warm confines of your cubical wooden refuge. But still, if there’s anything to learn from that <br>type of homeostasis whiplash, it’s that koselig is hardly limited to warm-inducing activities. In a related freezing vein, this morning was our first <br>real snowstorm of the year (we’ve had very brief snows previously but this was the first one that really stuck), and to welcome in the occasion I was <br>able to go on a nice run along the water and welcome in the oncoming winter - another experience that while warming to the heart was cold to particularly <br>my fingers and toes.

    This next week though, my discovery of what all constitutes koselig will be at least temporarily delayed, since I’m turning in the weather in the high teens <br>and low twenties for the significantly warmer airs of Portugal where I’ll be attending the European electronic monitoring conference as part of my <br>research. So, stay tuned for a non-Norway post coming from me soon, and in the meantime, I’ll be introducing my roommates to America’s own entry to the <br>koselig cannon: the Charlie Brown Thanksgiving and Christmas specials.

    <h3> 11/15/24</h3>
    <p>
    Norway has weighed in FIRMLY on the Christmas-decorations-before-or-after Thanksgiving debate. Turns out it’s a lot more straightforward when there’s no <br>turkey to be eaten around this time of year. Jultid (Jul, Norwegian for Christmas, is pronounced like ‘yule’, and tid is Norwegian for time) has hit <br>the ground running in Oslo, and with it have come a host of seasonal decorations and foods that I’m encountering in every corner of the city.
    <br><br>
    First, the foods. The ultimate debate in Norway, the proverbial pineapple-on-pizza debacle (but at least for me, a foreigner, significantly more novel <br>and interesting to talk about) is the debate around Julebrus. Brus is Norwegian for soda, and turns out this is the one time of year Norwegians will <br>put down their collective Pepsi Maxes in lieu of other flavors (still not diet coke though, if only they knew). The debate centers around the two <br>main types of Julebrus that are sold, one a red soda and the other brown. Both sodas, regardless of color, are exceptionally sweet - probably <br>something I’d liken most to something cotton candy flavor in the states. The red flavor in general tends to taste slightly more berry-like, while the <br>brown soda has more of a vanilla taste. Complicating the matter further is that many local breweries make their own version of Julebrus too, meaning <br>the debate is not just one of flavor but of local pride. Having tried the main grocery store brand of each so far, I have to say I lean more in the <br>brown Julebus camp, if nothing else because it comes in a glass bottle instead of a plastic one which makes it just a little more fun to drink à la <br>Jarritos. But, to quote the reddit page I consulted about the fierce Julebrus battle, “Whatever you think, your subjective opinion is objectively <br>wrong!”

    In significantly more peaceful matters, mulled wine is another popular Christmas drink, and served warm, it’s one of the cornerstones of Norwegian <br>Christmas markets, the first of which opened in the center of Oslo last week. Besides mulled wine, other stands at the market offer their wares of <br>churros, traditional Norwegian waffles, and the ever-Scandinavian pølser - Norway’s sausage-food-of-choice that straddles the line between bratwurst <br>and hot dog. Otherwise, stalls sell Christmas gifts such as wool sweaters and blankets, novelty meats and cheeses (whale jerky anyone?), and other <br>ornaments and trinkets that bring hundreds of people flocking to the scene on any given evening. Centering the spectacle is a large ferris wheel and <br>assorted small carnival games and rides for kids, and an ice skating rink that does not offer skates for rental, I guess because enough Norwegians <br>have their own to take along with them. It’s hard not to get swept up in the festivities, particularly as string lights now dot every walkway through <br>the center of the city, all directing you back towards the market like some kind of fluorescent runway.

    Helping the appeal is that it is now increasingly and objectively dark outside. I know this is something I’ve continued to repeat in my blogs, but as I <br>write with the full naivety of someone who has for the nearly past 10 years of my life lived somewhere that is inarguably Not dark, every couple <br>weeks it continues to shock me just the same. The effect of darkness in my experience so far is something like the effect of a casino or movie <br>theater, where the reality of using the level of light in the sky to indicate what time of day it is slowly loses its grip and all times of day seem <br>to be really more or less the same. When it is ‘daytime’ too, the fog rolling off the fjord now coats much of the city in a murky haze. The result is <br>sometimes jarring. 5pm and going out to stretch your legs? Pitch black outside! 1am and coming home from the bar? It’s no different! Though I haven’t <br>experienced the tiring effect some people report in the increased darkness (turns out I drink a lot of caffeine both in the light and the dark!), it <br>has required me to try to concretely time block my day out more to continue following a normal schedule. For the time being though, it’s something <br>that I’m particularly enjoying. In the fleeting moments where the sun does appear too, I love the way it pulls each person outside to bask in all the <br>warmth they can get, and for a brief moment in the middle of the day, the city is together in enjoying the beauty of the oncoming winter.

    <h3> 11/8/24</h3>
    <p>
    The most patriotic place I’ve been in the last year was in an auditorium tucked along the back of the University of Oslo’s student union building, <br>Chateau Neuf. Named for the student union’s mascot, a pig (neuf is the Norwegian onomatopoeia equivalent to oink, not a random use of French), the <br>building on this Tuesday night was decked in red, white, and blue. Admittedly these are also the colors of the Norwegian flag, but the Stars and <br>Stripes themselves were found everywhere: on flags, streamers, banners, and on advertisements promoting the Norwegian TV coverage of the results. <br>Yes, in the same building that proudly displays the writings of North Korea founder Kim Il Sung (student culture had a communist turn in the 70s and <br>80s I’ve been told), I was one of around a thousand students to attend a US election watch party.
    <br><br>
    Many Norwegians are closely attuned to US politics in ways that are sometimes not top of mind for Americans living in the states. For one, the actions of <br>NATO are of primary concern here. As someone who is fairly politically engaged, I know the basics of NATO: that it was founded as a military alliance <br>with the US and Western Europe following the end of World War II, and that its existence was used as a method of military pressure on the Soviet <br>Union through the Cold War. And I’m aware that it’s something that still exists, but it’s hardly something that dominates many political <br>conversations in the states, even in the context of foreign policy. However, for Norway, a member of NATO, the direction of the organization is one <br>of the largest concerns for Norwegians for national security and global politics. As it currently stands, the US has a significant military and <br>weapons presence in northern Norway (close to the Russian border), and just this year, an agreement was made that gives the US exclusive authority <br>over twelve military areas in the country, including the power to prosecute Norwegian citizens under American law in those areas. This setup <br>is not highly controversial, but in a country that otherwise is not a member of the EU, it means that Norwegian foreign policy is to a large extent shaped by <br>American leadership. For some people I’ve talked to, this reliance creates a unique type of election anxiety: one where not only the result is <br>unknown, but where you also have no say in the process.
    <br><br>
    The election party itself, besides being an excuse for a lot of students to drink on a Tuesday, included a series of speakers who gave their perspective <br>on the state of American politics. First, a professor of American Studies (a major that’s offered in most universities here), called in from Austin <br>where she was currently researching to give a brief overview of each of the swing states. She explained some of the main developments of the <br>election, including VP picks and general trends in voting (i.e. gender, age gaps in voting behavior). The call ended with a triumphant  prediction <br>that Kamala Harris would win, Ted Cruz would lose his Senate seat, and that possibly even Texas itself could turn blue on a federal level in the near <br>future. The second speaker, Thomas Seltzer, was born in Wisconsin before moving to Norway with his family at age six, where he now hosts a popular <br>Norwegian TV show called UXA. In it, he travels to small towns in America to ask people about the issues they face. His talk reflected that <br>perspective; he discussed how you could have voters who would support both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, and the general political disillusionment <br>and struggles felt by many working class Americans that precipitated Trump’s political rise. While particularly the Texas predictions have aged <br>poorly, it does hint at the gulf that exists sometimes between Norwegian and American politics. As my roommate Sebastian reminded me as we passed a <br>meeting room where the student group of the Høyre (right) Norwegian party was meeting, almost anyone in that room would’ve supported Kamala for <br>president.

    In the immediate fallout of the election, many of my coworkers and others I’ve chatted with have wanted to ask about the results, but fortunately I’ve <br>been spared the having-to-answer-for-your-country accusations that the Fulbright office had warned us were possible when we first arrived in the <br>country. There is some incredulity about Trump’s win, seen with the same sort of perspective the American studies professor had, but on a micro scale <br>Norwegian politics are trending the same direction. With the asterisk that Norwegian politics are much further left than the US’, Norway’s current <br>center-left parliament is expected to fall to a coalition made up of the Høyre and the further right Progress parties in next year’s election. In some <br>ways, this makes the results of the American election less staggering. America has joined many other countries, including the UK and France this year, <br>in seeing the political party that presided over post-COVID inflation to fall in dramatic fashion. Though the results are disheartening, to say the <br>least, it does give me some solace to see the results as one domino in a larger global phenomenon, and less of an indictment on American morality. In <br>the meantime too, I remain hopeful in imagining a political future outside of what the Democratic Party had deemed politically feasible - since that <br>certainly wasn’t the case.
    <br><br>
    On an unrelated note, I’ve picked up a few Norwegian sayings from my roommates and have been trying to fit them into everyday conversation. I’ll leave <br>the sayings in Norwegian and their literal translations but best of luck piecing together what they might mean :)
