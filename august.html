<h3>8/31/24</h3>
    <p>
    A big week that’s already rushing to its conclusion! Tuesday and Wednesday I had my orientation for the Norway Fulbright program, my first <br>chance to meet the other Americans who will also be abroad this year. It was an exciting couple days, and busy ones too - in between lots <br>of introductions we also officially kicked off the year with a reception at the Nobel Institute, where the winner for the Peace Prize is <br>selected. There, we were welcomed by the US embassy and Norwegian Ministry of Education, and had the opportunity to share a little about <br>our projects. The event was fun, but more than anything it was comforting to meet people going through the similar experience of settling <br>into a new country. We were able to bond over both the excitement (where to visit, beer menus in Norway, etc.) and the struggles (the 6 <br>hours I spent in a cramped San Francisco office for a ten minute residency appointment and similar horror stories) of the move so far, and <br>going forward it’s nice to know there’ll be plenty of friendly faces around the country to visit with couches to crash on!

    To finish up our orientation, we were served lunch with an assortment of popular Norwegian foods. While I’ve already been asking people I <br>meet what a Norwegian diet consists of (among the answers frozen pizza, tacos, and pepsi max - devastating to diet coke drinkers <br>everywhere) this was my first chance to have a full spread of new things to try. One of the main components of our meal was different <br>ingredients for matpakke (maht-pahk-uh), which directly translates to “packed lunch” but usually entails an open-faced sandwich on <br>dense, whole-grain bread. Norwegians typically have four meals - breakfast, lunch, dinner around 5pm, and supper before bed - and these <br>types of meals are common for everything except dinner. Common toppings include shrimp with mayo (actually great), mackerel with tomato <br>(jury’s still out), smoked salmon, or any type of usual lunch meat and cheese. Other options for breakfast include jam or brown cheese - a <br>Norwegian delicacy I’ve been told is only eaten by grandparents but is a salty, caramel-like cheese that immediately gets stuck to the <br>roof of your mouth (and it’s fantastic). To top things off, we finished with a selection of Norwegian desserts, among my favorites the <br>Kvikk Lunsj (quick lunch), the Norwegian version of a Kit Kat.

    In one last note, with nearly every Norwegian I’ve met one of the first questions I immediately get is my thoughts on the upcoming <br>election. For a lot of Norwegians, American politics seem like a kind of perverse reality show that they follow with a true-crime like <br>fascination. It’s a difficult subject to broach, even in an intensely liberal country where my political beliefs mostly align with the <br>people I’m talking to. It feels like the easy way out to play the “cool” American who thinks other Americans are stupid and backwards <br>(despite how strongly I might disagree with what is happening sometimes), when instead there’s an opportunity for a more productive <br>conversation about values, the two-party system, and political representation or lack thereof. It’s a weird balance to strike while also <br>trying to show I’m empathetic and culturally-sensitive, and something I’m still figuring out.

    Nothing like a couple mean 13 year olds to really inspire me to pick up the pace learning Norwegian! This week I revived my hockey career as 
    <br>a coach, where I’ll be assisting with two teams, U12 and U13, at a local club this year. Hockey has been such a large part of my life for <br>a long time, and sharing the game in a country where it’s not huge - surprising, given Norwegians love every other winter sport - was one <br>of my biggest goals for this year. 
    <br><br>
    In short, it’s been amazing so far. Stepping back on the ice was easy and natural, and each practice has flown by. But! As I’ve quickly found <br>out, there’s little filter, really ever with the kids, but particularly about my Norwegian accent (or lack thereof). When I’ve tried to <br>use Norwegian words or phrases around my roommates - like mentioning I wanted to go hiking in the nearby area of Akershus - I’ve mostly <br>gotten polite nods or corrections in pronunciation that usually end in a “close enough” after a few mostly futile attempts. With the kids, <br>no such luck. At my last practice, trying to learn the Norwegian words for blue and red (blå and rød), I asked two of the kids on the team <br>for help. After repeating the pronunciation back (blow and rue-uh, but obviously I’m not the authority here), they both looked at each <br>other and laughed. Humbling! A couple minutes later, I got a grimace from another kid when I asked what his name was in Norwegian (one of <br>very few phrases I felt confident about) before he told me my Norwegian didn’t make sense.

    On another note, it rains here! This is not remotely a surprise after even the most cursory Google search about the climate in Norway, but <br>I am quickly finding out the vast scientific consensus is no lie. I’m used to the type of rain in Arizona, where a storm is just some <br>quirky thing and rarely something that requires a rain jacket or umbrella. Caught in a storm? You might as well stand in it because it’s <br>the last you’re getting for a couple months. Here, you just end up already wet when you reenter the rain a couple hours later. To clarify, <br>I own a very capable rain jacket - I have all the resources at my disposal to avoid getting soaked. But, for whatever reason, when it <br>comes to walking out the door, my years of Arizona residency take over and I leave my apartment exposed to the elements. Anyways, this is <br>how I reached my hockey practice yesterday evening, running the walk from the metro stop to the rink, hockey bag slung over my shoulder <br>and avoiding the large puddles pooling on the mostly gravel path. Survival of the fittest and all that.
    <br><br>
    Otherwise, today marks one week in Norway! It feels like I’ve lived several lifetimes here already, but I’m excited for everything more that’s <br>still to come.

    <h3> 8/21/24 </h3>
    <p>
    It’s a little past noon, and I’m sitting on the second floor of the Oslo public library. The crowd is mixed - students like myself <br>clustered around desks and outlets, kids from school groups in yellow crossing guard vests running outside of the watch of their teachers, <br>and tourists wandering in from the nearby museums to snap a couple pictures before braving the rain once again. It’s an impressive <br>building, even in a city that noticeably dedicates itself to public spaces. Sitting on the harbor, it’s an Oslo landmark along with <br>the nearby opera house (operahuset). But regardless of the place, it’s here that I've come to say I'm nearly a week into my stay in <br>Norway.

    The first few days have been a blur, a mix of ikea stops, tourist sights, and return trips to ikea after realizing that I still don’t actually <br>have bedsheets. This too has been while not knowing much of the language at all - something that's made little things like getting <br>groceries more difficult so far. The time I've spent looking blankly at different brands of greek yogurt is absurd. Fortunately, most <br>people speak good English - particularly close to the city center, which has made asking for help relatively easy. Even still, I'm trying <br>to pick up as much Norwegian as I can, though right now that's mostly limited to hei's (means hi, pronounced the same way) and unnskyld <br>med's (means excuse me, pronounced oon-shill may). It's a work in progress - though I've been assured that Norwegians sometimes can't even <br>understand other Norwegians because some regional dialects are so strong.
    <br><br>
    Yesterday was my first day at KRUS, the University College of the Norwegian Correctional Service, where I’ll be spending my year <br>researching Electronic Monitoring - essentially house arrest - in Norway. Already, the Norwegian approach to corrections is much different <br>than anything I’ve worked with before. Here, the training to become a correctional officer is a two-year program (and may become a three-<br>year bachelor's degree soon), where in addition to practical training students get classes in social work, sociology, philosophy, and <br>criminology. While security is still a primary focus in prison, there's also a much greater emphasis on job training, education, and <br>living in a way that prepares people for life after their release. For one, Norwegian prisoners have a shared kitchen and make their own food, with <br>access to kitchen tools up to and including knives.
    <br><br>
    On one last note, my room is finally starting to look like a place where someone lives! Last night I set up my cork board, something for me <br>that always makes a place a home. It was the first thing I set up in my Barrett dorm, and the last thing I took down moving out from my <br>apartment a couple weeks ago. I’m hoping to add a couple more stickers and postcards as I travel around here, but for now it’s nice to <br>have some reminders of home :)
